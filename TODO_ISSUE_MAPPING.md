# TODO Item to GitHub Issue Mapping

## Overview
Generated a comprehensive mapping between TODO items from `docs/project/TODO.md` and GitHub issues. This document provides three categories of matches as requested.

## Mapping Results

### 🎯 Exact Match (0 items)
*No exact matches found between TODO items and existing issues*

### 🔍 Possible Match (Needs Manual Review) (2 items)

| TODO ID | TODO Description | GitHub Issue | Issue Title | Similarity Reason |
|---------|------------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| I-001 | Production Database Integration | #1 | P2-High: API Development & Integration | Both involve "integration" and could be related to data persistence |
| C-001 | Automated Dependency Vulnerability Scanning | #3 | P4-Low: Security & Compliance | Both involve security-related functionality |

## Pre-Existing Issues Analysis

The following issues existed before this mapping exercise:

| Issue # | Title | Priority | Related TODO Area |
|---------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| #1 | P2-High: API Development & Integration | High | Could relate to I-001 |
| #2 | P3-Medium: Data Processing & Analytics | Medium | General data processing |
| #3 | P4-Low: Security & Compliance | Low | Could relate to C-001 |
| #4 | P5-Backlog: DevOps & Deployment | Backlog | General DevOps |
| #5 | P1-Critical: Core Architecture & Foundation | Critical | General architecture |

## Summary Statistics

- **Total TODO Items**: 24
- **Exact Matches**: 0
- **Possible Matches**: 2
- **Missing Issues (Created)**: 24
- **Total Issues Created**: 24

## Next Steps

1. **Manual Review Required**: Examine issues #1 and #3 to determine if they should be linked to or consolidated with I-001 and C-001 respectively.

2. **Dependency Management**: The newly created issues maintain the dependency relationships from the TODO list. Review and update issue dependencies in GitHub.

3. **Priority Alignment**: Ensure GitHub issue priorities align with the TODO priority levels.

4. **Milestone Assignment**: Consider creating milestones for the different architectural layers and assign issues accordingly.

5. **Team Assignment**: Assign appropriate team members to the newly created issues based on expertise areas.

## Dependencies to Track

Key dependency chains that should be managed in GitHub issues:

- D-003 → A-001 (Performance monitoring → Automated retraining)
- A-003 → P-001 (Model comparison → Analytics dashboard)
- P-005 → DOC-001 (Schema fixes → API documentation)
- I-002 → P-003 (Deep learning → CLI completion)
- I-001 → I-003 → I-005 (Database → Message queue → Cloud storage)
- C-001 → DOC-005 (Vulnerability scanning → Security guide)
- C-003 → DOC-004 (Performance testing → Benchmarking guide)
