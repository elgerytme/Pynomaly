- ✅ Performance monitoring dashboards
- ✅ CI/CD integration for continuous monitoring
- ✅ Statistical analysis and reporting

### Integration Testing Suite
- ✅ Cross-package workflow validation
- ✅ End-to-end testing coverage
- ✅ API contract validation
- ✅ Event-driven integration testing
- ✅ Database integration verification

### Security Scanning Framework
- ✅ Automated vulnerability assessment
- ✅ Dependency security monitoring
- ✅ Static code security analysis
- ✅ License compliance validation
- ✅ Security policy enforcement

## Usage Examples

### Running All Tests
```bash
# Performance tests
python scripts/testing/performance_framework.py ci

# Integration tests
python scripts/testing/integration_testing_suite.py ci

# Security scanning
python scripts/security/security_scanning_framework.py ci
```

### CI/CD Integration
The GitHub Actions workflow automatically runs all three frameworks on:
- Push to main/develop branches
- Pull requests
- Daily scheduled runs

### Report Generation
All frameworks generate comprehensive HTML reports with:
- Visual charts and graphs
