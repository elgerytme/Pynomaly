# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

You are developing Pynomaly, a state-of-the-art Python anomaly detection package targeting Python 3.11+. This package integrates multiple anomaly detection libraries (PyOD, TODS, PyGOD, scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX) through a unified, production-ready interface following clean architecture principles.

## Core Architectural Principles

Follow **Clean Architecture**, **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, and **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)**:

1. **Domain Layer**: Pure Python business logic with no external dependencies
   - Entities: `Anomaly`, `Detector`, `Dataset`, `Score`, `DetectionResult`
   - Value Objects: `ContaminationRate`, `ConfidenceInterval`, `AnomalyScore`
   - Domain Services: Core detection logic, scoring algorithms

2. **Application Layer**: Orchestrate use cases without implementation details
   - Use Cases: `DetectAnomalies`, `TrainDetector`, `EvaluateModel`, `ExplainAnomaly`
   - Services: `DetectionService`, `EnsembleService`, `ModelPersistenceService`

3. **Infrastructure Layer**: All external integrations
   - Adapters: `PyODAdapter`, `TODSAdapter`, `PyGODAdapter`, `SklearnAdapter`
   - Data Sources: `CSVLoader`, `ParquetLoader`, `DatabaseLoader`, `StreamingLoader`
   - Persistence: `ModelRepository`, `ResultRepository`

4. **Presentation Layer**: User interfaces
   - REST API (FastAPI)
   - CLI (Click/Typer)
   - Python SDK
   - Progressive Web App (PWA) with HTMX, Tailwind CSS, D3.js, Apache ECharts

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- **Type Hints**: 100% coverage with `mypy --strict`
- **Async/Await**: For all I/O operations
- **Protocols**: Define interfaces using Python protocols
- **Dependency Injection**: Use `dependency-injector` or similar

## Development Workflow

1. **Always start** with domain models and protocols
2. **Test-first** approach with clear test cases
3. **Document** architectural decisions in ADRs
4. **Benchmark** performance impact of changes
5. **Use** conventional commits for clarity
6. **Maintain** backward compatibility
7. **Follow** semantic versioning strictly

## Key Priorities

1. **Clean, maintainable code** over premature optimization
2. **Extensibility** through well-defined interfaces
3. **Production readiness** from day one
4. **User experience** through intuitive APIs
5. **Performance** with profiling and optimization
6. **Security** by design, not as afterthought
7. **Documentation** as first-class citizen

## Remember

- This is a **production-grade** package, not a research prototype
- Every component should be **independently testable**
- Favor **composition over inheritance**
- Make the **simple case simple**, complex case possible
- **Fail fast** with clear error messages
- Consider **resource constraints** (memory, CPU, GPU)
- Design for **horizontal scalability**

## Claude Behavior Guidelines

- **Remain objective and critical**: Question assumptions, identify potential issues, and provide honest assessments
- **Avoid sycophancy**: Don't exaggerate claims or provide excessive praise for code quality or decisions
- **Be direct**: Point out problems, inefficiencies, or areas for improvement without sugar-coating
- **Focus on facts**: Base recommendations on technical merit, not on trying to please or agree
- **Challenge when appropriate**: If a design decision seems suboptimal, explain why and suggest alternatives

#### Integration with Development Workflow
1. **Before Starting Work**: Check TODO.md for planned work items
2. **During Development**: Keep notes of changes for changelog entry
3. **Upon Completion**: 
   - Update CHANGELOG.md with detailed entry
   - Mark TODO.md items as completed
   - Cross-reference between both files
   - Commit both files together with the feature
4. **Quality Check**: Ensure changelog entry includes sufficient detail for users

#### TODO.md Synchronization Rules
**MANDATORY: Automatic TODO.md Updates with Claude Code Internal Todos**

Claude Code MUST automatically synchronize the internal todo system with TODO.md following these rules:

**📋 Synchronization Requirements:**
1. **Bidirectional Sync**: Changes in either Claude Code todos or TODO.md must trigger updates in both
2. **Real-Time Updates**: Synchronization occurs immediately when:
   - New Claude Code todos are created using TodoWrite
   - Todo status changes (pending → in_progress → completed)
   - TODO.md is manually edited with new tasks or status updates
   - Logical units of work are completed

**📝 TODO.md Integration Process:**
1. **Task Creation**: When TodoWrite creates new tasks, automatically add them to TODO.md "Current Work in Progress" section
2. **Status Updates**: When todo status changes, update corresponding entries in TODO.md with appropriate symbols:
   - ⏳ **Pending**: Tasks in pending status
   - 🔄 **In Progress**: Tasks actively being worked on
   - ✅ **Completed**: Tasks marked as completed
3. **Completion Documentation**: When tasks are completed, move them to the "Latest Completed" section with:
   - Detailed description of work accomplished
   - Technical specifications and features implemented
   - Cross-references to related files, commits, or documentation

**🔄 Automatic Update Triggers:**
- **Every TodoWrite call**: Update TODO.md current work section
- **Task completion**: Move completed items to "Latest Completed" with full documentation
- **Milestone completion**: Create new "Latest Completed" section with comprehensive summary
- **Session end**: Ensure all todo changes are reflected in TODO.md

**📊 TODO.md Structure Maintenance:**
1. **Current Work Section**: Always reflects active Claude Code todos
2. **Priority Ordering**: High priority todos appear first in each section
3. **Progress Tracking**: Include percentage completion estimates for complex tasks
4. **Cross-References**: Link todos to specific files, commits, or documentation sections

**🎯 Implementation Requirements:**
- Claude Code must check TODO.md at conversation start and sync with any existing tasks
- All todo operations must include automatic TODO.md updates
- TODO.md changes must be committed along with related code changes
- Maintain chronological order in "Latest Completed" sections with most recent first

**Example Integration:**
```markdown
### 🔄 Current Work in Progress
- 🔄 **ACTIVE: Implementing user authentication system** (Priority: High)
  - ✅ Create JWT token service
  - 🔄 Implement login/logout endpoints  
  - ⏳ Add session management
  - ⏳ Create password reset functionality
```

This ensures complete transparency and maintains TODO.md as the authoritative source of project status while leveraging Claude Code's internal todo system for task management.

#### Automation Triggers
- **Git Hooks**: Pre-commit hooks to remind about changelog updates
- **PR Templates**: Include changelog update checklist in pull request templates
- **CI Validation**: Check that CHANGELOG.md was modified in feature branches
- **Release Process**: Aggregate changelog entries for version releases
- **TODO Sync Validation**: Ensure TODO.md reflects all Claude Code todo changes

## Important Notes
- Always ensure the virtual environment is activated before installing packages or running code
- The `.gitignore` currently excludes the VS Code workspace file (`Pynomaly.code-workspace`)
- Follow the architectural principles strictly to maintain clean separation of concerns
- **CRITICAL**: Always keep `requirements.txt` in sync with `pyproject.toml` core dependencies. When adding/removing dependencies in `pyproject.toml`, immediately update `requirements.txt` to include only the non-optional dependencies needed for basic functionality

## Web UI Technology Stack
- **HTMX**: Provides dynamic behavior with minimal JavaScript, keeping complexity server-side
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid, consistent UI development
- **D3.js**: For creating custom, interactive anomaly visualizations
- **Apache ECharts**: For statistical charts, time series plots, and dashboards
- **PWA**: Progressive Web App features for offline capability and installability
  - Service workers handle offline caching and background sync
  - Web app manifest enables installation on desktop and mobile
  - IndexedDB for client-side data storage
  - Push API for real-time anomaly notifications
