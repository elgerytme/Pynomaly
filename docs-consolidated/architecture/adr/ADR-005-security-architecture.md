🍞 **Breadcrumb:** 🏠 [Home](../../../index.md) > 👨‍💻 [Developer Guides](../../README.md) > 🏗️ [Architecture](../README.md) > 📋 [ADR](README.md) > Security Architecture

## Status

PLANNED

## Context

### Problem Statement
Pynomaly requires a comprehensive security architecture that addresses authentication, authorization, data protection, and threat detection to ensure system integrity and user privacy.

### Goals
- Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Ensure end-to-end data encryption and protection
- Establish security monitoring and incident response capabilities
- Comply with industry security standards and regulations

### Constraints
- Must meet regulatory compliance requirements
- Should minimize impact on system performance
- Must integrate with existing infrastructure
- Should support various deployment environments

### Assumptions
- Security threats will continue to evolve
- Compliance requirements will become more stringent
- Users will expect enterprise-grade security features
- Security measures must be transparent to end users
