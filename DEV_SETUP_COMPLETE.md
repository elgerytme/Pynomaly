# Pynomaly Development Environment Setup - Complete ✅

## Summary

The Hatch development environment has been successfully bootstrapped with the following components:

### Core Setup
- ✅ **Created isolated `.venv`** under `environments/` directory
- ✅ **Installed Pynomaly in editable mode** with all `[dev]` extras
- ✅ **Registered pre-commit hooks** automatically

### Created Components

#### 1. Cross-Platform Scripts
- **Linux/macOS**: `scripts/dev_setup.sh` - Bash script for Unix systems
- **Windows**: `scripts/dev_setup.ps1` - PowerShell script for Windows

#### 2. Makefile Integration
- **Added `dev` target** to existing Makefile that wraps the setup commands
- **Cross-platform compatible** with proper error handling

#### 3. Updated README
- **Added Development Setup section** with clear instructions
- **Cross-platform examples** for all operating systems
- **Manual command alternatives** for environments without make

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Quick development environment setup

# Linux/macOS with make:
make dev

# Or use the development script directly:
# Linux/macOS:
./scripts/dev_setup.sh

# Windows PowerShell:
.\scripts\dev_setup.ps1

# Or run the commands manually:
hatch env create dev
hatch run dev:setup
```

### What the Setup Does

1. **Creates Development Environment**: `hatch env create dev`
2. **Installs Dependencies**: Installs Pynomaly in editable mode with all development extras
3. **Sets up Pre-commit Hooks**: `pre-commit install` for code quality enforcement
4. **Configures Environment**: Uses `environments/.venv` as the isolated environment location

### Environment Verification

The development environment is now ready at:
- **Location**: `C:\Users\andre\Pynomaly\environments\.venv`
- **Package**: Installed in editable mode
- **Pre-commit**: Hooks installed and functional
- **Dependencies**: All `[dev]` extras installed

### Next Steps

Developers can now use:
- `hatch run dev:` prefix for all development commands
- Pre-commit hooks are automatically triggered on commits
- The environment is isolated and reproducible across different systems
