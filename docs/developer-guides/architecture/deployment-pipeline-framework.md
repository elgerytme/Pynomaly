---


## Overview

The Pynomaly Deployment Pipeline Framework provides enterprise-grade automated deployment and serving infrastructure for anomaly detection models. This framework enables seamless model lifecycle management from development through production deployment with comprehensive monitoring, scaling, and rollback capabilities.

## Core Architecture Components

### 1. Deployment Orchestration Service
Central service managing the complete deployment lifecycle:
- **Environment Management**: Dev, staging, production environment orchestration
- **Deployment Strategies**: Blue-green, canary, rolling deployments
- **Resource Allocation**: Automatic scaling and resource optimization
- **Dependency Management**: Container and service dependency resolution

### 2. Model Serving Infrastructure
Production-ready serving layer with enterprise capabilities:
- **REST API Gateway**: High-performance inference endpoints
- **Batch Processing Engine**: Large-scale batch prediction capabilities
- **Streaming Pipeline**: Real-time anomaly detection for streaming data
- **Load Balancing**: Intelligent request distribution across model instances

### 3. Container Orchestration
Kubernetes-native deployment with Docker containerization:
- **Model Containers**: Lightweight, self-contained model serving images
- **Auto-scaling**: Horizontal pod autoscaling based on load and performance
- **Service Mesh**: Istio integration for traffic management and security
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive health checks and self-healing capabilities

### 4. Environment Promotion Pipeline
Automated workflows for model progression through environments:
- **Development**: Local testing and initial validation
- **Staging**: Integration testing and performance validation
- **Production**: Live deployment with monitoring and alerting
- **Rollback Mechanisms**: Automated rollback on performance degradation

## Deployment Strategies

### 1. Blue-Green Deployment
- **Zero-downtime deployments**: Maintain two identical production environments
- **Instant rollback**: Switch traffic back to previous version immediately
- **Resource efficiency**: Higher resource usage but maximum safety

### 2. Canary Deployment
- **Gradual rollout**: Route small percentage of traffic to new version
- **Risk mitigation**: Monitor performance before full deployment
- **Automated progression**: Increase traffic percentage based on success criteria

### 3. Rolling Deployment
- **Progressive updates**: Replace instances one by one
- **Resource optimization**: Minimal additional resource requirements
- **Continuous availability**: Service remains available throughout deployment

## Security and Compliance

### Authentication and Authorization
- **JWT-based authentication**: Secure API access with token validation
- **Role-based access control**: Fine-grained permissions for deployment operations
- **API rate limiting**: Protection against abuse and resource exhaustion
- **Audit logging**: Comprehensive audit trail for all deployment activities

### Data Privacy and Security
- **Encryption in transit**: TLS 1.3 for all API communications
- **Encryption at rest**: Model artifacts and data encrypted in storage
- **Input validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization and validation
- **GDPR compliance**: Data anonymization and right-to-forget capabilities

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics Collection
- **Prediction metrics**: Accuracy, latency, throughput, error rates
