🍞 **Breadcrumb:** 🏠 [Home](../../../index.md) > 👨‍💻 [Developer Guides](../../README.md) > 🏗️ [Architecture](../README.md) > 📋 [ADR](README.md) > Data Pipeline Architecture

## Status

PLANNED

## Context

### Problem Statement
Pynomaly requires a robust data pipeline architecture to handle various data sources, transformations, and anomaly detection workflows efficiently and scalably.

### Goals
- Design scalable data ingestion and processing pipelines
- Support real-time and batch processing modes
- Ensure data quality and validation throughout the pipeline
- Enable monitoring and observability of data flows

### Constraints
- Must support multiple data formats and sources
- Should handle both streaming and batch data
- Must ensure data consistency and reliability
- Should integrate with existing anomaly detection algorithms

### Assumptions
- Data volumes will grow significantly over time
- Multiple data sources will need to be supported
- Real-time processing requirements will increase
- Data quality issues will need automated handling
