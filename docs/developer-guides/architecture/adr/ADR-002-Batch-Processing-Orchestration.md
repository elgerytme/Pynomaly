# ADR-002: Batch Processing Orchestration Architecture

## Status
**Draft** - Pending stakeholder review and approval

## Context

The Pynomaly system currently has basic batch processing capabilities through the `BatchProcessor` component, but lacks comprehensive orchestration for large-scale batch processing operations. Users need to process datasets up to 100GB in size with configurable batch sizes, comprehensive monitoring, and integration with the existing pipeline orchestration system.

### Current State
- Basic `BatchProcessor` supports multiple engines (Sequential, Multiprocessing, Threading, Dask, Ray)
- Limited integration with pipeline orchestration
- Manual configuration and monitoring
- Basic error handling and retry logic
- Processing limited to ~1GB datasets effectively

### Problem Statement
The current batch processing implementation has several limitations:
1. **Scale Limitations**: Cannot efficiently process large datasets (>10GB)
2. **Orchestration Gap**: No integration with pipeline orchestration workflows
3. **Monitoring Deficiencies**: Limited visibility into batch processing progress
4. **Resource Management**: No dynamic resource allocation or optimization
5. **Error Handling**: Basic retry logic without sophisticated recovery mechanisms

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive batch processing orchestration system (A-002) that extends the existing architecture with new use cases, enhanced orchestration, and improved monitoring capabilities.

### Architecture Decision

#### 1. Use Case Layer Addition
Create `BatchProcessingUseCases` in the application layer to handle:
- Batch processing job creation and configuration
- Job execution orchestration
- Progress monitoring and reporting
- Error handling and recovery coordination

#### 2. Pipeline Integration Enhancement
Extend `PipelineOrchestrationService` to support:
- Batch-specific pipeline steps
- Scheduling integration for batch operations
- Dependency management between batch and streaming pipelines
- Resource allocation coordination

#### 3. Domain Service Enhancement
Enhance `ProcessingOrchestrator` to provide:
- Unified session management for batch and streaming
- Resource-aware job scheduling
- Cross-mode orchestration capabilities

#### 4. Infrastructure Layer Extensions
Enhance `BatchProcessor` with:
- Improved resource management
- Enhanced monitoring integration
- Better error handling and recovery
- Checkpoint-based fault tolerance

#### 5. Supporting Services
Add new application services:
- `BatchResourceManager`: Dynamic resource allocation
- `BatchMonitoringService`: Enhanced monitoring integration
- `BatchPipelineStep`: Specialized pipeline step for batch operations

## Rationale

### Why This Approach

#### 1. **Clean Architecture Compliance**
- Maintains separation of concerns across layers
- Uses existing dependency injection patterns
- Follows established repository and service patterns

#### 2. **Backward Compatibility**
- Extends existing components rather than replacing them
- Maintains existing API contracts
- Allows gradual migration of existing batch processing users

#### 3. **Scalability**
- Supports horizontal scaling through multiple batch engines
- Enables resource optimization through dynamic allocation
- Provides foundation for future microservices migration

#### 4. **Observability**
- Integrates with existing monitoring infrastructure
- Provides comprehensive metrics and logging
- Enables real-time progress tracking

#### 5. **Fault Tolerance**
- Implements checkpointing for large job recovery
- Provides sophisticated retry and recovery mechanisms
- Maintains data consistency during failures

### Alternative Approaches Considered

#### Alternative 1: Microservices-Based Architecture
**Pros:**
- Independent scaling of batch processing
- Technology flexibility
- Isolated failure domains

**Cons:**
- Increased complexity for current system size
- Additional infrastructure requirements
- More complex deployment and monitoring

**Decision:** Rejected - Too much complexity for current requirements

#### Alternative 2: External Workflow Engine Integration
**Pros:**
- Leverage existing workflow solutions (Airflow, Prefect)
- Rich workflow management features
- Proven scalability

**Cons:**
- Additional external dependencies
- Learning curve for team
- Integration complexity with existing system

**Decision:** Rejected - Increases external dependencies and complexity

#### Alternative 3: Event-Driven Architecture
**Pros:**
- Loose coupling between components
- Flexible message routing
- Scalable event processing

**Cons:**
- Eventual consistency challenges
- Complex error handling
- Additional infrastructure (message queues)

**Decision:** Rejected - Not suitable for synchronous batch processing requirements
