🍞 **Breadcrumb:** 🏠 [Home](../../../index.md) > 👨‍💻 [Developer Guides](../../README.md) > 🏗️ [Architecture](../README.md) > 📋 [ADR](README.md) > Performance Optimization

## Status

PLANNED

## Context

### Problem Statement
Pynomaly requires systematic performance optimization strategies to ensure scalability, responsiveness, and efficient resource utilization as the system grows and handles increasing workloads.

### Goals
- Achieve optimal system performance under various load conditions
- Implement efficient resource utilization strategies
- Establish performance monitoring and optimization processes
- Ensure scalability for future growth

### Constraints
- Must maintain system reliability while optimizing performance
- Should minimize impact on development velocity
- Must work within existing infrastructure limitations
- Should support various deployment environments

### Assumptions
- Performance requirements will increase with system adoption
- Resource optimization will become increasingly important
- Performance bottlenecks will emerge in different system components
- Continuous optimization will be needed
