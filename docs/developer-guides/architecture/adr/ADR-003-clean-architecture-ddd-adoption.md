**Status:** DRAFT  
**Date:** 2025-01-08  
**GitHub Issue:** [#40](https://github.com/elgerytme/Pynomaly/issues/40)

## Context

We need to formalize our architectural decision regarding the adoption of Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles in the Pynomaly project.

### Key Considerations:
- Need for maintainable, testable architecture
- Separation of concerns across layers
- Domain-driven design principles
- Dependency inversion and clean boundaries
- Scalability and team productivity requirements

## TODO

- [ ] Document the decision to adopt Clean Architecture
- [ ] Define DDD boundaries and ubiquitous language
- [ ] Document layer responsibilities and dependencies
- [ ] Define aggregates and entities
- [ ] Document integration patterns
- [ ] Create implementation guidelines
- [ ] Define testing strategies for each layer
- [ ] Document migration strategy from current architecture

## Decision

**[TO BE COMPLETED]**

## Consequences

## Status

This ADR is currently in **DRAFT** status and requires completion.
