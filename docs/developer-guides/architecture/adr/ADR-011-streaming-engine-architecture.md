## Status

PROPOSED

## Context

### Problem Statement
Pynomaly needs to support real-time anomaly detection for streaming data sources, requiring a robust streaming engine that can handle high-velocity data while maintaining low latency and high throughput. The current batch-oriented processing model is insufficient for use cases requiring immediate anomaly detection.

### Goals
- Enable real-time anomaly detection with <100ms latency
- Support multiple streaming data sources (Kafka, Kinesis, WebSocket)
- Maintain >10,000 records/second throughput
- Provide fault tolerance and exactly-once processing guarantees
- Support both stateful and stateless anomaly detection algorithms

### Constraints
- Must integrate with existing algorithm registry system
- Memory usage must be bounded for continuous operation
- Must support horizontal scaling
- Must work with existing monitoring and alerting systems
- Must maintain compatibility with batch processing workflows

### Assumptions
- Streaming data sources will provide structured data formats
- Algorithm performance characteristics are suitable for streaming
- Network latency between components is <10ms
- Data ordering may not be guaranteed in all streaming scenarios

## Decision

### Chosen Solution
Implement a **Streaming Engine** based on Apache Kafka Streams with custom processing topology for anomaly detection.

### Rationale
Apache Kafka Streams provides mature streaming capabilities with exactly-once processing guarantees, distributed state management, and horizontal scaling. This enables real-time anomaly detection while maintaining system reliability and performance.

## Architecture

### System Overview
```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Data Sources"
        K[Kafka Topics]
        KIN[Kinesis Streams]
        WS[WebSocket Feeds]
    end

    subgraph "Streaming Engine"
        SI[Stream Ingestion]
        SP[Stream Processor]
        SS[State Store]
        AD[Anomaly Detector]
    end

    subgraph "Output Channels"
        AS[Alert Stream]
        RS[Result Stream]
        MS[Metrics Stream]
    end

    K --> SI
    KIN --> SI
    WS --> SI

    SI --> SP
    SP --> SS
    SP --> AD

    AD --> AS
    AD --> RS
    AD --> MS
```

### Component Interactions
```mermaid

    participant DS as Data Source
    participant SI as Stream Ingestion
    participant SP as Stream Processor
    participant AD as Anomaly Detector
    participant SS as State Store
    participant AS as Alert Stream

    DS->>SI: stream_data
    SI->>SP: validated_record
    SP->>SS: get_state(key)
    SS->>SP: current_state
    SP->>AD: process_record(data, state)
    AD->>SS: update_state(key, state)
    AD->>AS: anomaly_result
```

## Options Considered

### Pros and Cons Matrix

| Option | Pros | Cons | Score |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| **Apache Kafka Streams** | ‚úÖ Mature platform<br/>‚úÖ Exactly-once processing<br/>‚úÖ Horizontal scaling | ‚ùå Kafka dependency<br/>‚ùå Learning curve | **9/10** |
| Apache Flink | ‚úÖ Low latency<br/>‚úÖ Event time processing | ‚ùå Operational complexity<br/>‚ùå Steeper learning curve | 8/10 |
| Custom Solution | ‚úÖ Full control<br/>‚úÖ Minimal dependencies | ‚ùå Development overhead<br/>‚ùå Reliability concerns | 5/10 |

### Rejected Alternatives
- **Apache Flink**: Too complex for current needs and adds operational overhead
- **Custom Solution**: Would require significant development effort and reliability concerns

## Implementation

### Technical Approach
1. Set up Kafka Streams infrastructure
2. Implement multi-source data ingestion layer
3. Create anomaly detection processing topology
4. Add state management for stateful algorithms
5. Implement output streams for results and alerts

### Migration Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Implement streaming engine alongside batch processing
2. **Phase 2**: Migrate real-time use cases to streaming
3. **Phase 3**: Gradually transition remaining workloads

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for stream processing components
- Integration tests with algorithm registry
- Performance tests for throughput and latency
- Chaos engineering for fault tolerance

## Consequences

### Positive
- Real-time anomaly detection capabilities
- Scalable streaming infrastructure
- Fault-tolerant processing
- Integration with existing systems

### Negative
- Additional operational complexity
- Kafka infrastructure dependency
- Learning curve for streaming paradigms
- Increased memory and compute requirements

### Neutral
- New monitoring requirements for streaming metrics
- Changes to deployment architecture
- Additional testing requirements

## Compliance

### Security Impact
- Stream encryption for data in transit
- Authentication and authorization for stream access
- Audit logging for stream processing events

### Performance Impact
- Target: <100ms processing latency
- Target: >10,000 records/second throughput
- Memory: Bounded by configurable state store sizes

### Monitoring Requirements
- Stream processing latency metrics
- Throughput and error rate monitoring
- Kafka lag and consumer group health
- State store size and performance metrics
