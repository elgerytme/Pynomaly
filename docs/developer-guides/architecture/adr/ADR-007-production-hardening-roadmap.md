🍞 **Breadcrumb:** 🏠 [Home](../../../index.md) > 👨‍💻 [Developer Guides](../../README.md) > 🏗️ [Architecture](../README.md) > 📋 [ADR](README.md) > Production Hardening Roadmap

## Status

PROPOSED

## Context

### Problem Statement
Pynomaly is transitioning from a development-focused codebase to a production-ready system. The current implementation lacks critical production features including robust error handling, comprehensive monitoring, security hardening, performance optimization, and operational tooling. This creates risks for production deployments and limits the system's reliability and maintainability.

### Goals
- **Reliability**: Achieve 99.9% uptime with graceful degradation
- **Security**: Implement comprehensive security controls and vulnerability management
- **Performance**: Optimize system performance for production workloads
- **Observability**: Provide comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting
- **Operational Excellence**: Enable efficient deployment, maintenance, and troubleshooting
- **Compliance**: Meet security and operational compliance requirements

### Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing APIs
- Changes must be implemented incrementally with minimal disruption
- Must work across multiple deployment environments (cloud, on-premise, hybrid)
- Performance improvements cannot introduce breaking changes
- Must align with trunk-based development practices

### Assumptions
- Production deployments will require enterprise-grade reliability
- Security threats will evolve requiring adaptive security measures
