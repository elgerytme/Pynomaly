# ADR-004: Repository & Unit-of-Work Pattern

**Status:** DRAFT  
**Date:** 2025-01-08  
**GitHub Issue:** [#34](https://github.com/elgerytme/Pynomaly/issues/34)

## Context

We need to formalize our architectural decision regarding the implementation of Repository and Unit-of-Work patterns for data access in the Pynomaly project.

### Key Considerations:
- Data access layer abstraction
- Transaction management and consistency
- Testability and mocking of data layer
- Support for multiple data sources
- Performance and caching strategies

## TODO

- [ ] Document the decision to adopt Repository pattern
- [ ] Define Unit-of-Work implementation approach
- [ ] Document transaction boundaries
- [ ] Define repository interfaces and implementations
- [ ] Document data access patterns
- [ ] Define caching strategies
- [ ] Document migration patterns for existing data access
- [ ] Create testing guidelines for repositories

## Decision
