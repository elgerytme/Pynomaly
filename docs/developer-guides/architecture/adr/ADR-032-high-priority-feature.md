## Status

PROPOSED

## Context

### Problem Statement
Issue #32 requests a high priority feature implementation. The issue is marked as "enhancement" with "High-P2" label, indicating significant business value but lacking detailed specification.

### Goals
- Implement a high-priority feature that aligns with the Pynomaly project's anomaly detection capabilities
- Ensure the feature integrates seamlessly with existing architecture
- Maintain high code quality and testing standards as per project rules

### Constraints
- Must follow Test Driven Development (TDD) principles
- Must maintain clean git history with atomic commits
- Must be compatible with existing PWA architecture
- Must pass all existing tests before implementation

### Assumptions
- The feature will enhance the core anomaly detection functionality
- Implementation will require both backend and frontend components
- Feature will be user-facing and require UI/UX considerations

## Decision

### Chosen Solution
**PENDING DETAILED REQUIREMENTS** - This ADR serves as a placeholder and design framework until Issue #32 is properly specified with:
- Detailed acceptance criteria
- Functional requirements
- Technical specifications
- User stories or use cases

### Rationale
Without detailed requirements, we cannot make informed architectural decisions. This ADR establishes the decision-making framework and ensures proper architecture review when requirements are clarified.

## Architecture

### System Overview
```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Current State"
        A[Pynomaly Core]
        B[API Layer]
        C[Frontend PWA]
        D[Database]
    end
    
    subgraph "Proposed State (TBD)"
        E[Enhanced Feature Module]
        F[API Extensions]
        G[UI Components]
        H[Data Layer Updates]
    end
    
    A --> E
    B --> F
    C --> G
    D --> H
```

### Component Interactions
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant F as Frontend
    participant A as API
    participant C as Core System
    participant D as Database
    
    Note over U,D: Sequence TBD - Pending Requirements
    
    U->>F: Feature Request
    F->>A: API Call
    A->>C: Process Request
    C->>D: Data Operations
    D->>C: Response
    C->>A: Result
    A->>F: API Response
    F->>U: Feature Result
```

## Options Considered

### Pros and Cons Matrix

| Option | Pros | Cons | Score |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| **Wait for Requirements** | ‚úÖ Prevents over-engineering<br/>‚úÖ Ensures proper scope | ‚ùå Delays implementation<br/>‚ùå Blocks progress | **9/10** |
| Implement Generic Feature | ‚úÖ Shows progress<br/>‚úÖ Demonstrates capability | ‚ùå Risk of wrong solution<br/>‚ùå Potential rework | 3/10 |
| Research and Propose | ‚úÖ Proactive approach<br/>‚úÖ Shows initiative | ‚ùå May not align with actual needs<br/>‚ùå Time investment risk | 5/10 |

### Rejected Alternatives
- **Generic Implementation**: Rejected due to lack of specific requirements and risk of building wrong solution
- **Research-Based Proposal**: Rejected as it may not align with actual business needs

## Implementation

### Technical Approach
**PENDING REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION**

When requirements are clarified, implementation will follow:
1. **TDD Approach**: Write failing tests first
2. **Clean Architecture**: Maintain separation of concerns
3. **Git Best Practices**: Feature branch with atomic commits
4. **Code Quality**: Follow existing project standards
5. **UI/UX Standards**: Ensure high-quality user experience

### Migration Strategy
TBD - Depends on feature scope and impact on existing functionality

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- UI automation tests for user interface
- Performance tests if applicable
- Security tests for data handling

## Consequences

### Positive
- Establishes proper architectural decision-making process
- Ensures requirements are properly gathered before implementation
- Maintains project quality standards
- Prevents technical debt from hasty implementation

### Negative
- Delays immediate implementation
- Requires additional stakeholder communication
- May impact project timeline expectations

### Neutral
- Creates documentation trail for future reference
- Establishes precedent for handling under-specified requirements

## Compliance

### Security Impact
TBD - Security assessment required once feature scope is defined

### Performance Impact
TBD - Performance analysis required based on feature specifications

### Monitoring Requirements
TBD - Monitoring strategy depends on feature functionality
