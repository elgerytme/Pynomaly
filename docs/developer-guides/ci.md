This document covers the continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices for Pynomaly, including automated testing, quality gates, and deployment pipelines.

## Overview

Pynomaly uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation, ensuring code quality, security, and reliability through automated testing and deployment pipelines.

## CI/CD Pipeline Components

### Build Pipeline
- **Code Quality Checks**: Automated linting, formatting, and static analysis
- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive test suite execution
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end testing scenarios
- **Security Scanning**: Dependency and code vulnerability scanning
- **Documentation**: Automated documentation generation and validation

### Deployment Pipeline
- **Staging Deployment**: Automated deployment to staging environment
- **Production Deployment**: Controlled production releases
- **Rollback Procedures**: Automated rollback capabilities
- **Environment Management**: Infrastructure as code

## Regression & Quality Gates

### Quality Assurance Script

The project includes an automated quality assurance script that monitors and enforces quality standards:

**Script Location**: `scripts/quality_gates.py`

**Purpose**: Automated quality monitoring and regression detection to maintain 100% quality standards across all project components.

### Quality Thresholds

The following quality thresholds are enforced:

#### Code Quality
- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 95% (Target: 100%)
- **Linting Score**: 10/10 (Ruff)
- **Type Coverage**: 100% (MyPy strict mode)
- **Security Score**: 100% (Bandit)

#### Test Quality
- **Unit Test Pass Rate**: 100%
- **Integration Test Pass Rate**: 100%
- **Performance Test Pass Rate**: 100%
- **UI Test Pass Rate**: 100%

#### Documentation Quality
- **Documentation Coverage**: 100%
- **Link Validation**: 100%
- **Accessibility Compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA

### Nightly Quality Pipeline

**Schedule**: Every night at 00:00 UTC

**Pipeline**: `.github/workflows/nightly-quality.yml`

**Actions**:
1. **Full Test Suite**: Comprehensive testing across all components
2. **Performance Benchmarks**: Regression testing for performance metrics
3. **Security Audit**: Full security scan including dependencies
4. **Documentation Validation**: Link checking and accessibility testing
5. **Quality Report Generation**: Updated quality KPI badges and reports

**Failure Handling**:
- Automatic issue creation for quality regressions
- Slack/email notifications to development team
- Branch protection activation for critical failures

### Branch Protection Rules

Quality gates are enforced through GitHub branch protection rules:

#### Main Branch Protection
- **Required Status Checks**: All CI checks must pass
- **Require branches to be up to date**: Prevents merge conflicts
- **Require pull request reviews**: Minimum 1 reviewer required
- **Dismiss stale reviews**: On new commits
- **Require linear history**: Enforce clean commit history

#### Quality Gate Enforcement
- **Minimum Code Coverage**: 95%
- **All Tests Must Pass**: Zero tolerance for failing tests
- **Security Checks**: No high/critical vulnerabilities
- **Code Quality**: Linting and formatting compliance

### Emergency Override Procedures

In critical situations, quality gates can be temporarily bypassed:

#### Override Process
1. **Create Emergency Issue**: Document the emergency situation
2. **Obtain Approval**: Get approval from project maintainer
3. **Temporary Bypass**: Use GitHub admin override
4. **Create Remediation Plan**: Document fix timeline
5. **Quality Restoration**: Restore quality standards immediately after fix

#### Override Commands
```bash
# Temporarily disable specific quality gate
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/branches/main/protection \
  --method PATCH \
  --field enforce_admins=false

# Re-enable after emergency fix
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/branches/main/protection \
  --method PATCH \
  --field enforce_admins=true
```

#### Emergency Contact
- **Primary**: Project maintainer
- **Secondary**: DevOps team
- **Escalation**: Technical lead

### Quality Metrics Dashboard

Real-time quality metrics are available through:

- **GitHub Actions Dashboard**: Live status of all quality checks
- **Quality KPI Badge**: Current quality percentage in README
- **Nightly Reports**: Detailed quality analysis reports
- **Trend Analysis**: Historical quality metrics tracking

### Automated Remediation

When quality regressions are detected:

1. **Immediate Notification**: Alert development team
2. **Automatic Issue Creation**: Create GitHub issue with details
3. **Rollback Trigger**: Automatic rollback for critical failures
4. **Remediation Suggestions**: AI-powered fix recommendations
5. **Prevention Measures**: Update quality gates to prevent recurrence

### Integration with Development Workflow

Quality gates are integrated into the development process:

- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Local quality checks before commit
- **Pull Request Validation**: Automated quality review
- **Merge Blocking**: Prevent merge of low-quality code
- **Deployment Gates**: Quality validation before deployment

## Security Considerations

### Secrets Management
- Environment-specific secrets stored in GitHub Secrets
- Rotation procedures for sensitive credentials
- Audit logging for secret access

### Access Control
- Role-based access to CI/CD systems
- Multi-factor authentication required
- Regular access reviews and cleanup

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Pipeline Monitoring
- Real-time pipeline status monitoring
- Performance metrics tracking
- Failure rate analysis

### Alerting Configuration
- Immediate alerts for pipeline failures
- Quality regression notifications
- Security vulnerability alerts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Test Failures**: Check test logs and recent changes
- **Build Failures**: Verify dependencies and environment
- **Deployment Issues**: Check deployment logs and rollback if needed

### Support Channels
- **Internal**: Development team Slack
- **Documentation**: CI/CD troubleshooting guide
- **Escalation**: DevOps team support
