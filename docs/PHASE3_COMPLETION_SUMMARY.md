## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation Highlights

### Integration Testing Capabilities
```python
# End-to-end workflow testing with complete data pipeline
def test_complete_anomaly_detection_workflow(self, sample_dataset):
    # Complete workflow: load ‚Üí detect ‚Üí train ‚Üí predict ‚Üí export
    train_result = mock_train_use_case.execute(detector_id, dataset_id)
    detect_result = mock_detect_use_case.execute(detector_id, dataset_id, threshold=0.5)
    export_result = mock_export_use_case.execute(result_id, format="csv")
    
    assert train_result.success is True
    assert detect_result.summary["anomalies_detected"] == 1
    assert export_result.success is True
```

### Performance Testing Framework
```python
# Performance monitoring with real-time metrics
with performance_monitor:
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=concurrent_requests) as executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(simulate_api_call, endpoint) for endpoint in endpoints]
        results = [future.result() for future in futures]

assert performance_monitor.execution_time < 5.0
assert statistics.mean(response_times) < 0.1
```

### Contract Validation System
```python
# JSON Schema validation for API contracts
api_schemas = {
    "detector_request": {
        "type": "object",
        "required": ["name", "algorithm"],
        "properties": {
            "name": {"type": "string", "minLength": 1},
            "algorithm": {"type": "string", "enum": ["IsolationForest", "LOF"]}
        }
    }
}

validate(instance=request_data, schema=api_schemas["detector_request"])
```

### Cross-Platform Compatibility Testing
```python
# Platform-specific behavior validation
os_specific_tests = {
    "Windows": {"path_separator": "\\", "case_sensitive": False},
    "Linux": {"path_separator": "/", "case_sensitive": True},
    "Darwin": {"path_separator": "/", "case_sensitive": False}
}

assert os.path.sep == expected_separator
```
