# Documentation Domain Leakage Prevention - Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the complete implementation of rules and automation to prevent documentation domain leakage in the repository.

## Overview

The implementation provides comprehensive protection against documentation domain leakage through:
1. **Clear rules and policies** for documentation boundaries
2. **Automated scanning tools** to detect violations
3. **Integration with development workflow** through hooks and CI/CD
4. **Enforcement mechanisms** that prevent violations from being committed

## Implementation Components

### 1. Documentation Domain Boundary Rules (`docs/rules/DOCUMENTATION_DOMAIN_BOUNDARY_RULES.md`)

**Purpose**: Establishes clear rules for documentation domain boundaries

**Key Rules**:
- Package documentation must not reference other packages
- Repository documentation must remain generic
- Code examples must use appropriate import patterns
- Configuration examples must be domain-appropriate

**Coverage**:
- Rule definitions with specific violation patterns
- Examples of correct and incorrect usage
- Validation rules with regex patterns
- Configuration guidelines

### 2. Enhanced Domain Boundaries Configuration (`.domain-boundaries.yaml`)

**Purpose**: Extends existing configuration with documentation rules

**New Sections**:
- `documentation.rules`: Specific rules for documentation scanning
- `documentation.exceptions`: Approved exceptions with expiration dates
- `options.documentation`: Documentation-specific scanning options

**Rule Types**:
- `no_cross_package_references_in_package_docs`: Critical severity
- `no_package_specific_refs_in_repo_docs`: Critical severity  
- `no_monorepo_imports`: Warning severity
- `no_absolute_package_imports_in_package_docs`: Warning severity

### 3. Documentation Scanner Service

**File**: `src/packages/tools/domain_boundary_detector/core/domain/services/documentation_scanner.py`

**Capabilities**:
- Scans `.md` and `.rst` files for domain boundary violations
- Supports regex pattern matching with configurable rules
- Handles code block detection and import statement validation
- Generates reports in multiple formats (console, JSON, markdown)
- Provides actionable suggestions for fixing violations

**Key Features**:
- Scope-based rule application (package docs vs repo docs)
- Exception handling with expiration dates
- Self-reference detection for package documentation
- Contextual violation reporting with line numbers

### 4. Integrated Boundary Detector

**File**: `src/packages/tools/domain_boundary_detector/core/domain/services/integrated_boundary_detector.py`

**Purpose**: Combines code and documentation scanning into unified service

**Features**:
- Unified scanning of both Python code and documentation
- Integrated reporting across violation types
- Configurable scanning modes (code-only, docs-only, both)
- Exit code determination for CI/CD integration

### 5. Enhanced CLI Interface

**File**: `src/packages/tools/domain_boundary_detector/cli.py`

**New Commands**:
- `scan`: Enhanced with `--include-docs`, `--include-code`, `--docs-only` options
- `scan-docs`: Dedicated command for documentation-only scanning

**New Options**:
- `--include-docs`: Include documentation in scanning (default: true)
- `--include-code`: Include Python code in scanning (default: true)
- `--docs-only`: Scan only documentation files
- `--strict`: Exit with error code on violations

**Usage Examples**:
```bash
# Scan everything (code + docs)
python -m domain_boundary_detector.cli scan

# Scan only documentation
python -m domain_boundary_detector.cli scan --docs-only

# Dedicated docs command
python -m domain_boundary_detector.cli scan-docs

# Strict mode for CI/CD
python -m domain_boundary_detector.cli scan-docs --strict
```

### 6. Pre-commit Hook Integration

**Files**:
- `scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit-docs-validation`: Pre-commit validation script
- `scripts/install_documentation_hooks.py`: Hook installation script

**Features**:
- Validates documentation files before commit
- Checks both individual files and repository-level consistency
- Provides detailed violation reports with fix suggestions
- Blocks commits with critical violations
- Supports bypass with `--no-verify` (discouraged)

**Installation**:
```bash
python scripts/install_documentation_hooks.py
```

### 7. CI/CD Integration

**File**: `.github/workflows/documentation-boundary-check.yml`

**Triggers**:
- Pull requests affecting documentation files
- Pushes to main/develop branches with doc changes

**Features**:
- Automated validation on every PR
- Detailed violation reports as PR comments
- Artifact uploads for investigation
- Status checks preventing merge on violations
- Support for multiple output formats

**Workflow Steps**:
1. Environment setup with Python and dependencies
2. Configuration validation
3. Documentation boundary scanning
4. Report generation and artifact upload
5. PR commenting with violation details
6. Status check creation
7. Failure on violations found

## Usage Guide

### For Developers

**Daily Development**:
1. Write documentation following domain boundary rules
2. Use relative imports in code examples within package docs
3. Keep repository-level docs generic
4. Pre-commit hooks will validate changes automatically

**Fixing Violations**:
1. Run `python -m domain_boundary_detector.cli scan-docs` locally
2. Review violation reports with specific line numbers
3. Apply suggested fixes (relative imports, generic references)
4. Re-run validation to confirm fixes

### For Package Maintainers

**Package Documentation Guidelines**:
- Use relative imports: `from .module import Class`  
- Avoid other package references: ~~`from anomaly_detection import`~~
- Keep examples self-contained within package scope
- Reference only declared dependencies

**Repository Documentation Guidelines**:
- Use generic concepts: "detection services" not "anomaly_detection package"
- Avoid specific package paths: ~~`src/packages/ai/mlops`~~
- Focus on patterns and interfaces
- Use placeholder examples

### For CI/CD Pipeline

**Automated Enforcement**:
- All documentation changes are automatically validated
- Critical violations block PR merging
- Detailed reports help developers understand and fix issues
- Status checks integrate with branch protection rules

**Configuration Management**:
- Rules defined in `.domain-boundaries.yaml`
- Exceptions require approval and expiration dates
- Regular review of exceptions and rule effectiveness

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Reviews

1. **Monthly**: Review documentation exceptions and their expiration dates
2. **Quarterly**: Analyze violation patterns and update rules if needed
3. **Annually**: Comprehensive review of documentation domain architecture

### Metrics to Track

- Number of documentation violations by type and severity
- Time to fix violations after detection
- Exception usage and expiration compliance
- Developer adoption of documentation standards

### Rule Updates

When updating documentation rules:
1. Update `.domain-boundaries.yaml` configuration
2. Test changes with existing documentation
3. Update rule documentation
4. Communicate changes to development teams
5. Monitor for new violation patterns

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Architectural Integrity**
