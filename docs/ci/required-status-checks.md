# Required Status Checks for Branch Protection

This document outlines the required status checks that should be configured for branch protection rules based on the analysis of GitHub Actions workflows.

## Analysis Summary

**Date:** 2025-07-09  
**Analysis Method:** Local testing using `act pull_request` for workflow validation  
**Workflows Analyzed:** 4 key workflows (quality-gates.yml, ci.yml, test.yml, security.yml)

## Workflow Analysis Results

### 1. Quality Gates Workflow (`quality-gates.yml`)
**Status:** ✅ **PASSED** - All jobs validated successfully

**Key Jobs to Include in Branch Protection:**
- `Quality Gate Summary / Quality Gate Summary` - Final summary job that aggregates all quality gate results
- `Quality Gates / Code Quality Metrics` - Code quality metrics analysis
- `Quality Gates / Test Quality Gate` - Core test execution validation
- `Quality Gates / Performance Quality Gate` - Performance benchmarks
- `Quality Gates / Security Quality Gate` - Security vulnerability scanning

**Required Outputs:**
- Coverage percentage (min 85%)
- Cyclomatic complexity (max 10)
- Maintainability index score
- Security issue count
- Performance test results

### 2. CI Workflow (`ci.yml`)
**Status:** ❌ **FAILED** - YAML syntax error detected

**Issue Found:** Line 482 contains malformed YAML in template string that causes parsing failure

**Key Jobs (when fixed):**
- `Continuous Integration / CI Summary` - Main CI pipeline summary
- `Continuous Integration / Build & Package` - Package building validation
- `Continuous Integration / Test Suite` - Test execution across Python versions
- `Continuous Integration / Code Quality & Linting` - Code quality checks
- `Continuous Integration / Security & Dependencies` - Security scanning
- `Continuous Integration / Docker` - Container build verification

**Required Matrix Jobs:**
- Test Suite: Python 3.11, 3.12 with unit/integration test types
- Cross-platform compatibility validation

### 3. Test Suite Workflow (`test.yml`)
**Status:** ✅ **PASSED** - All jobs validated successfully

**Key Jobs to Include in Branch Protection:**
- `Test Suite / test-reports` - Test reporting and PR comments
- `Test Suite / security-tests` - Security validation
- `Test Suite / test-matrix-*` - Domain, Application, Infrastructure, E2E, and Contract tests
- `Test Suite / test-dependencies-*` - Dependency level testing (minimal, standard, full)

**Matrix Coverage:**
- **OS:** Ubuntu, Windows, macOS
- **Python Versions:** 3.11, 3.12, 3.13
- **Test Types:** unit, integration, performance
- **Test Suites:** Domain, Application, Infrastructure, E2E, Contract
- **Dependency Levels:** minimal, standard, full

### 4. Security Workflow (`security.yml`)
**Status:** ✅ **PASSED** - All jobs validated successfully

**Key Jobs to Include in Branch Protection:**
- `Security Scanning / Security Summary` - Aggregated security scan results
- `Security Scanning / Code Security Analysis` - Bandit security analysis
- `Security Scanning / Dependency Vulnerability Scan` - Safety and pip-audit checks
- `Security Scanning / CodeQL Analysis` - GitHub CodeQL analysis (Python & JavaScript)
- `Security Scanning / Secret Scanning` - TruffleHog secret detection
- `Security Scanning / License Compliance Check` - License compatibility validation

**Security Tools Used:**
- Bandit (code security)
- Safety (dependency vulnerabilities)
- pip-audit (dependency auditing)
- CodeQL (static analysis)
- TruffleHog (secret detection)
- License compliance checking

## Recommended Required Status Checks

Based on this analysis, the following status checks should be configured as **required** for branch protection:

### Critical/Blocking Checks
1. **Quality Gate Summary / Quality Gate Summary** - Must pass all quality gates
2. **Continuous Integration / CI Summary** - Must pass all CI pipeline steps
3. **Test Suite / test-reports** - Must pass comprehensive test suite
4. **Security Scanning / Security Summary** - Must pass all security scans

### Supporting Checks (Recommended)
1. **Quality Gates / Security Quality Gate** - High-severity security issues = 0
2. **Continuous Integration / Build & Package** - Package must build successfully
3. **Test Suite / security-tests** - Security-focused tests must pass
4. **Security Scanning / Code Security Analysis** - Bandit security analysis
5. **Security Scanning / Dependency Vulnerability Scan** - No critical vulnerabilities

## Configuration Notes

### Environment Variables Required
- `PYTHON_VERSION`: Target Python version (3.11, 3.12)
- `MIN_COVERAGE`: Minimum coverage threshold (85%)
- `MAX_COMPLEXITY`: Maximum cyclomatic complexity (10)
- `MAX_LINES_PER_FILE`: Maximum lines per file (500)

### Failure Conditions
- **Coverage below 85%** - Quality gate fails
- **Cyclomatic complexity > 10** - Quality gate fails
- **High-severity security issues > 0** - Security gate fails
- **Known vulnerabilities detected** - Security gate fails
- **Test failures** - CI pipeline fails

## Issues to Fix

### 1. CI Workflow YAML Syntax Error
**File:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`  
**Line:** ~482  
**Issue:** Malformed YAML in template string within github-script action
**Impact:** Complete workflow failure
**Priority:** HIGH - Must be fixed before enabling CI status checks

### 2. Missing Job Dependencies
Some workflows reference jobs that may not exist in the current configuration (e.g., `maintenance` job referenced in ci.yml but not defined).

## Maintenance

This document should be updated whenever:
- New workflows are added
- Existing workflows are modified
- Job names or structure changes
- Branch protection requirements change
