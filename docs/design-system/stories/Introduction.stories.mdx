# Pynomaly Design System

Welcome to the **Pynomaly Design System**  a comprehensive, accessibility-first design system for building consistent and intuitive anomaly detection interfaces.

## <¯ Purpose

This design system provides a unified set of components, patterns, and guidelines to:

- **Ensure consistency** across all Pynomaly applications and interfaces
- **Accelerate development** with reusable, well-tested components
- **Maintain accessibility** standards (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- **Support multiple themes** including light and dark modes
- **Enable responsive design** across devices and screen sizes

## <× Architecture

Our design system is built with modern web technologies:

- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling and responsive design
- **Web Components** for framework-agnostic component architecture
- **Progressive Web App** features for offline capability and performance
- **Accessibility-first** approach with comprehensive ARIA support
- **Performance optimized** with critical CSS and lazy loading

## <¨ Design Principles

### 1. **Clarity & Simplicity**
Clear visual hierarchy and intuitive interactions that help users focus on their anomaly detection tasks.

### 2. **Accessibility First**
Every component meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards with keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and sufficient color contrast.

### 3. **Data-Driven Design**
Components optimized for data visualization, charts, and complex analytical workflows.

### 4. **Responsive & Adaptive**
Seamless experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices with touch-friendly interactions.

### 5. **Performance & Reliability**
Fast loading, smooth animations, and reliable interactions that work across all modern browsers.

## =€ Getting Started

### Using Components

All components are designed to work with minimal configuration:

```html
<!-- Basic button -->
<button class="btn-primary">Detect Anomalies</button>

<!-- Anomaly status indicator -->
<div class="status-indicator status-anomaly">
  <span class="status-icon"> </span>
  <span class="status-text">Anomaly Detected</span>
</div>

<!-- Chart container -->
<div class="chart-container" data-component="chart">
  <!-- Chart content -->
</div>
```

### Theme Support

Switch between light and dark themes:

```html
<body class="theme-light"> <!-- or theme-dark -->
  <!-- Your content -->
</body>
```

### Responsive Design

All components automatically adapt to different screen sizes using Tailwind's responsive utilities:

```html
<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3">
  <!-- Responsive grid layout -->
</div>
```
