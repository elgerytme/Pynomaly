# Pynomaly Access Control Policy

## 1. Overview

This Access Control Policy establishes the framework for managing user access to Pynomaly systems, data, and resources. It defines the principles, procedures, and responsibilities for ensuring appropriate access controls are maintained across the organization.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:
- All Pynomaly systems and applications
- All data and information assets
- All users, including employees, contractors, and third parties
- All access methods (local, remote, administrative)
- All environments (development, staging, production)

## 3. Access Control Principles

### 3.1 Principle of Least Privilege
- Users are granted the minimum access necessary to perform their job functions
- Access rights are regularly reviewed and adjusted based on role changes
- Temporary access is time-limited and purpose-specific

### 3.2 Need-to-Know Basis
- Access to sensitive information is restricted to users with a legitimate business need
- Data classification levels determine access requirements
- Compartmentalization of sensitive information is enforced

### 3.3 Segregation of Duties
- Critical functions are divided among multiple individuals
- No single user has complete control over critical processes
- Approval workflows are implemented for sensitive operations

### 3.4 Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of access controls are implemented
- Authentication and authorization are separate processes
- Regular monitoring and auditing of access activities
