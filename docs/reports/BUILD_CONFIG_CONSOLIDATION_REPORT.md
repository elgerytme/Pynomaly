# Build Configuration Consolidation Report

**Date**: 2025-07-22 14:06:52  
**Process**: Phase 1.2 - Consolidate Build Configurations  
**Scope**: Remove redundant [build-system] sections from pyproject.toml files

## Summary

This report documents the consolidation of build configurations as part of the Buck2 
enhancement roadmap. The goal was to remove redundant [build-system] sections from 
pyproject.toml files in packages that have BUCK files, since Buck2 handles building.

## Results

- **Packages processed**: 23
- **Mixed configurations found**: 23  
- **Packages consolidated**: 23
- **Backup files created**: 23
- **Errors**: 0

## What Changed

### Before Consolidation
```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[project]
name = "example-package"
version = "0.1.0"
# ... rest of project metadata
```

### After Consolidation
```toml
[project]
name = "example-package"
version = "0.1.0"
# ... rest of project metadata
```

## Benefits

1. **Eliminated configuration duplication** - No more conflicts between BUCK and pyproject.toml build systems
2. **Simplified maintenance** - Single source of truth for build configuration (BUCK files)
3. **Reduced complexity** - Cleaner pyproject.toml files focused on metadata and tooling
4. **Improved consistency** - All packages now use Buck2 exclusively for builds

## Preserved Configurations

The consolidation process preserved all important configurations:

- ✅ **Project metadata** - name, version, description, authors, etc.
- ✅ **Dependencies** - production and optional dependencies  
- ✅ **Scripts and entry points** - CLI commands and entry points
- ✅ **Tool configurations** - black, ruff, mypy, pytest, coverage settings
- ✅ **URLs and classifiers** - project links and PyPI classifiers

## Next Steps

1. **Test builds** - Verify Buck2 builds work correctly for all consolidated packages
2. **Update CI/CD** - Ensure CI pipelines use Buck2 exclusively
3. **Documentation** - Update build documentation to reflect Buck2-only approach
4. **Monitoring** - Watch for any issues with the consolidated configurations

## Rollback Procedure

If issues occur, restore from backup:

```bash
# Restore all packages from backup
python scripts/buck2/consolidate_build_configs.py \
    --restore-backup 20250722_140652

# Restore specific package
cp temp/build_config_backups/<timestamp>/src/packages/<domain>/<package>/pyproject.toml \
   src/packages/<domain>/<package>/pyproject.toml
```

## Status

✅ **SUCCESS**: All packages consolidated successfully!

The build configuration consolidation is complete. 
All packages now use Buck2 as the exclusive build system while maintaining 
all important project metadata and tooling configurations.
