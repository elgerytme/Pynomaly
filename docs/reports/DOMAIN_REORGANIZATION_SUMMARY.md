# Domain Reorganization Summary

## Overview
Successfully completed major domain boundary fix by redistributing content from software/interfaces, software/mobile, software/services, and ops packages to their proper domain-specific locations.

## Phase 1: Software Package Restructuring âœ…

### 1.1 software/interfaces â†’ data/anomaly_detection âœ…
- **API endpoints** â†’ Moved to `data/anomaly_detection/api/`
  - All detection, automl, explainability, streaming endpoints
  - Authentication, middleware, security components
  - OpenAPI documentation and examples
- **CLI commands** â†’ Moved to `data/anomaly_detection/cli/`
  - Detection, automl, ensemble, explainability commands
  - Performance, benchmarking, and quality tools
- **Web interfaces** â†’ Moved to `data/anomaly_detection/web/`
  - Dashboard, monitoring, visualization interfaces
  - Templates and static assets
- **Python SDK** â†’ Moved to `data/anomaly_detection/sdk/`
  - Client libraries and domain-specific SDKs
  - JavaScript SDK (without node_modules)
  - Documentation and examples

### 1.2 software/mobile â†’ Proper domains âœ…
- **Quality monitoring** â†’ Moved to `data/data_observability/mobile/`
- **Push notifications** â†’ Moved to `software/core/notifications/`
- **Offline storage** â†’ Moved to `software/core/storage/`

### 1.3 software/services â†’ Domain-specific locations âœ…
- **Anomaly detection services** â†’ Moved to `data/anomaly_detection/services/`
- **ML services** â†’ Moved to `ai/mlops/services/`
- **Data platform services** â†’ Moved to `data/data_observability/services/`

## Phase 2: Core Directory Elimination âœ…

### 2.1 software/core/domain/entities redistribution âœ…
- **Anomaly detection entities** â†’ Moved to `data/anomaly_detection/domain/entities/`
  - ab_test.py, dataset.py, explainability.py
- **ML entities** â†’ Moved to `ai/mlops/domain/entities/`
  - automl.py, model.py
- **Generic entities** â†’ Kept in `software/core/domain/entities/`
  - Generic detector and base components

### 2.2 Core directories eliminated âœ…
- Removed nested "core" directories that were causing problems
- Redistributed content to proper domain layers

## Phase 3: Operations Package Restructuring âœ…

### 3.1 ops/infrastructure â†’ software/core/infrastructure âœ…
- **Generic infrastructure** â†’ Moved to `software/core/infrastructure/`
  - Health monitoring, value objects
  - Application and domain abstractions

### 3.2 ai/mlops/anomaly_detection_mlops â†’ data/anomaly_detection/mlops âœ…
- **MLOps components** â†’ Moved to `data/anomaly_detection/mlops/`
  - Model entities and core MLOps functionality

## Phase 4: Directory Cleanup âœ…

### 4.1 Deleted inappropriate directories âœ…
- **ops/config/** â†’ Confirmed not existing
- **src/packages/services/** â†’ Successfully deleted

## Benefits Achieved

### âœ… Proper Domain Boundaries
- Anomaly detection functionality consolidated in `data/anomaly_detection/`
- ML operations properly placed in `ai/mlops/`
- Generic software components in `software/core/`

### âœ… Eliminated Domain Leakage
- No more domain-specific code in generic software packages
- Clear separation of concerns maintained
- Proper domain-driven design structure

### âœ… Improved Maintainability
- Related functionality grouped together
- Easier to locate and modify domain-specific code
- Clear package boundaries and responsibilities

### âœ… Cleaner Architecture
- Removed confusing "core" directories
- Eliminated duplicate service directories
- Proper layering within each domain

## Next Steps Required

### ðŸ”„ Import Statement Updates (In Progress)
- Update all import references to new package locations
- Fix circular dependency issues
- Update pyproject.toml dependencies

### ðŸ”„ Validation and Testing
- Run tests to ensure functionality
- Verify package structure integrity
- Check for broken references

## File Structure Summary

### Created/Enhanced Packages:
- `data/anomaly_detection/api/` - API endpoints and documentation
- `data/anomaly_detection/cli/` - Command-line interface
- `data/anomaly_detection/web/` - Web interfaces and templates
- `data/anomaly_detection/sdk/` - SDKs and client libraries
- `data/anomaly_detection/mlops/` - MLOps functionality
- `data/data_observability/mobile/` - Mobile quality monitoring
- `software/core/notifications/` - Generic notification services
- `software/core/storage/` - Generic storage services
- `software/core/infrastructure/` - Generic infrastructure components

### Cleaned Up:
- Removed `src/packages/services/` entirely
- Eliminated nested "core" directories
- Consolidated domain-specific functionality

## Impact Assessment

### âœ… Domain Compliance
- All packages now respect domain boundaries
- No more software/interfaces domain leakage
- Clear separation of generic vs domain-specific code

### âœ… Monorepo Structure
- Proper domain-driven package organization
- Clear feature and functionality boundaries
- Improved discoverability and navigation

### âœ… Development Experience
- Easier to find domain-specific code
- Clear package responsibilities
- Better code organization and maintenance

The domain reorganization has successfully eliminated major domain boundary violations and established a clean, maintainable package structure that respects domain-driven design principles.
