# Domain Leakage Analysis & Prevention

## Root Cause Analysis: How Did This Happen?

### 1. **Lack of Domain Boundary Enforcement**
- **No automated validation** of domain boundaries
- **No clear domain ownership** documentation
- **No architectural review process** for new features
- **No domain-specific package constraints**

### 2. **Organic Growth Without Governance**
- Features were added to the most convenient location
- Generic `software/interfaces` became a dumping ground
- No domain expert review of new functionality
- Technical debt accumulated without refactoring

### 3. **Missing Architectural Constraints**
- **No dependency direction rules** (e.g., business → technical, not reverse)
- **No cross-domain communication patterns** enforced
- **No domain size limits** or complexity metrics
- **No import/export boundary definitions**

### 4. **Development Process Issues**
- **No domain-driven design practices** in development workflow
- **No code review checklists** for domain boundaries
- **No architectural decision records** for domain changes
- **No periodic domain health assessments**
