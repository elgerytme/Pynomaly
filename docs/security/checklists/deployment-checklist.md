## Overview

This checklist ensures that security measures are enforced during the Deployment phase. Use it during deployment configuration, rollout activities, and at the release gate.

**📋 For use:** Deployment scripts, release gates, production rollout planning

- [ ] **Secrets Management**
  - [ ] Secrets managed through secure storage
  - [ ] Environment-specific secrets isolated
  - [ ] Secrets rotation procedures verified
  - [ ] Access control for secret access
  - 📖 **Reference:** [Secrets Management](../security-best-practices.md#secrets-management)

### Infrastructure Security
- [ ] **Network Security**
  - [ ] Firewall configurations validated
  - [ ] Network security policies enforced
  - [ ] Secure VPN tunnels established
  - [ ] Network segmentation maintained
  - 📖 **Reference:** [Network Policies](../security-best-practices.md#network-policies)

- [ ] **Cloud Security**

### Production Rollout Security
- [ ] **Zero Trust Deployment**
  - [ ] Identity verification for all actors
  - [ ] Minimal privilege enforcement
  - [ ] Just-in-time access provisioning
  - [ ] Continuous trust assessment

- [ ] **Deployment Automation Security**
  - [ ] Automated deployment scripts validated
  - [ ] Revert procedures defined
  - [ ] Deployment logs securely stored
  - [ ] Automated integrity checks in place

---

## Post-Deployment Security Verification

### Security Monitoring
- [ ] **Security Metrics**
  - [ ] Key security metrics tracked
  - [ ] Alerts for anomalous activity
  - [ ] Real-time monitoring dashboards
  - [ ] Incident detection thresholds defined

- [ ] **Continuous Monitoring**
  - [ ] Regular security scans scheduled
  - [ ] Infrastructure monitoring agents installed
  - [ ] Vulnerability alerts configured
  - [ ] Threat intelligence integration

### Incident Response
- [ ] **Readiness and Procedures**
  - [ ] Incident response plan activated
  - [ ] Communication protocols tested
  - [ ] Post-incident analysis scheduled
  - [ ] Legal and compliance reviews arranged
  - 📖 **Reference:** [Incident Response](../security-best-practices.md#incident-response)

- [ ] **Recovery and Critique**
