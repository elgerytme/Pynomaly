# Security Checklists: SDLC Phase-Specific

🍞 **Breadcrumb:** 🏠 [Home](../../index.md) > 📁 [Security](../README.md) > 📋 Phase Checklists

## Overview

This directory contains phase-specific security checklists for each stage of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). These checklists ensure security considerations are integrated throughout the development process and provide clear guidance for engineers during PR reviews and release gates.

Each checklist references the main **[Security Best Practices Guide](../security-best-practices.md)** for detailed implementation guidance.

## How to Use These Checklists

### For Development Teams
1. **Select the appropriate checklist** for your current SDLC phase
2. **Review each item** in the checklist during the relevant activities
3. **Use the reference links** to access detailed implementation guidance
4. **Check off completed items** as you progress through the phase
5. **Ensure all items are completed** before moving to the next phase

### For Security Teams
1. **Use checklists during security reviews** to ensure comprehensive coverage
2. **Customize checklists** based on specific project requirements
3. **Track completion** across multiple projects and teams
4. **Use as audit trails** for compliance and governance purposes

### For Release Gates
1. **Integrate checklists** into your release gate processes
2. **Require completion** of relevant checklists before release approval
3. **Document exceptions** and risk acceptance for any incomplete items
4. **Maintain audit trails** of checklist completion for compliance

## Integration with Development Workflows

### Pull Request Templates
These checklists can be integrated into PR templates. For example:

```markdown
## Security Checklist
- [ ] **Implementation Phase Security:** [Implementation Checklist](docs/security/checklists/implementation-checklist.md) completed
- [ ] **Security controls** implemented according to design specifications
- [ ] **Input validation** properly implemented for all user inputs
- [ ] **Security testing** cases added for new functionality
- [ ] **Secrets management** follows established patterns
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration
Checklists can be integrated into automated checks:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Security Checklist Validation
  run: |
    # Check if security implementation requirements are met
    python scripts/security/validate_security_checklist.py \
      --phase=implementation \
      --checklist=docs/security/checklists/implementation-checklist.md
```

### Release Gate Process
Use checklists as part of release gate criteria:

1. **Pre-Release Review:** All phase-specific checklists completed
2. **Security Sign-off:** Security team validates checklist completion
3. **Documentation:** Checklist completion documented in release notes
4. **Audit Trail:** Checklist completion tracked for compliance

---

## Customization Guidelines

### Project-Specific Adaptations
- **Add project-specific items** relevant to your technology stack
- **Remove items** that don't apply to your deployment model
- **Adjust reference links** to point to your internal documentation
- **Modify approval processes** to match your organizational structure

### Industry-Specific Considerations
- **Healthcare:** Add HIPAA-specific requirements
- **Financial Services:** Include PCI-DSS compliance items
- **Government:** Add FISMA/FedRAMP specific controls
- **EU Operations:** Ensure comprehensive GDPR coverage

---

## Compliance and Audit Support

### Audit Trail Generation
Each checklist completion should generate an audit trail including:
- **Checklist version** used
- **Completion date** and responsible party
- **Any exceptions** or risk acceptances
- **Approval signatures** from security team

### Compliance Mapping
These checklists support various compliance frameworks:
- **GDPR:** Privacy and data protection controls
- **SOC 2:** Security controls and monitoring
- **ISO 27001:** Information security management
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework:** Comprehensive security controls

---

## Maintenance and Updates

### Checklist Maintenance
- **Regular reviews** to ensure current best practices
- **Updates** based on new threats and vulnerabilities
- **Feedback integration** from development and security teams
- **Version control** for checklist changes

### Continuous Improvement
- **Track completion rates** across teams and projects
- **Identify common gaps** and provide additional training
- **Collect feedback** on checklist effectiveness
- **Iterate and improve** based on real-world usage
