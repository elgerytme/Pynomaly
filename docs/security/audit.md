# Security Infrastructure Audit

## Existing Files

1. **GitHub Actions - Security Workflow** (`.github/workflows/security.yml`):
   - Runs `safety`, `pip-audit`, and `bandit` for dependency and code vulnerability checks.
   - Uploads results in SARIF format for GitHub Security integration.
   - No direct aggregation or consolidation of emitted SARIF files.

2. **Makefile**:
   - Contains commands for continuous integration and development workflows.
   - Pre-commit hooks are set up but not directly security-focused.

3. **Pre-commit Configuration** (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`):
   - Includes security checks for merge conflicts and private keys.
   - No specific rules for running `bandit` or another security tool.

4. **Project Configuration - Hatch** (`pyproject.toml`):
   - Contains environment settings and dependencies.
   - Hatch environments are defined, but do not include security scanning environments or shortcuts for a one-command security scan.

5. **Docker-compose - Security features** (`deploy/docker/docker-compose.hardened.yml`):
   - Provides hardened configurations to minimize privileges and security risks.
   - Uses `security_opt` to restrict privileges.

6. **Kubernetes Network Policies** (`deploy/kubernetes/security-policies.yaml`):
   - Network policies are defined to control ingress/egress traffic between different components and namespaces.
   - Ensures security compliance but is unrelated to code vulnerabilities.

## Identified Gaps

- **SARIF Consolidation**: Reports are uploaded independently; missing consolidation step.
- **One-command Scan**: There is no simple, one-command solution to run all security checks locally.
- **Failure Gating**: No mechanism in place to gate merges or releases based on severity of findings.

## Recommendations

- **Add SARIF Consolidation** in GitHub Actions or a separate script to aggregate all SARIF outputs.
- **Create a Unified Security Command** in `Makefile` or Hatch configuration to run all security checks with one command.
- **Introduce Failure Gating** on severe findings, possibly within the CI/CD pipeline or pre-commit hooks.
