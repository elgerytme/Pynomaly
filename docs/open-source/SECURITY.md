## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. Please help us maintain the security of this project by reporting vulnerabilities responsibly.

### Private Disclosure Process

1. **Do NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security details to: security@project.org
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fixes (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Development**: Within 30 days for critical issues
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed (coordinated disclosure)

### Security Review Process

#### Automated Security Scanning
- **SAST**: Static Application Security Testing in CI/CD
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection in dependencies
- **Container Scanning**: Docker image security analysis
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Security policy validation for Kubernetes/Terraform

#### Manual Security Reviews
- Security team review for all security-related changes
- Code review focuses on:
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Cryptographic implementations
  - Data protection and privacy
  - Secure defaults and configurations

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors
