# Architecture Decision Record: Enhancing FastAPI with New Routers and WebSocket Endpoints

## Context
We aim to enhance the existing FastAPI application by adding new routes and WebSocket endpoints for management and workflows capabilities.

## Decision
Integrate new REST API routers `/api/management`, `/api/workflows`, and a real-time WebSocket endpoint `/ws/real-time-detection`.

## Consequences
1. Enhanced user experience with real-time capabilities.
2. Improved separation of concerns with dedicated routers.
3. Needs additional security review to ensure data protection across new endpoints.
