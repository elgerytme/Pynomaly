So that I can easily experiment with different approaches without changing code

Given I have a dataset and want to try different algorithms
When I use the DetectionService with different algorithm parameters
Then I should get consistent results across all adapter types
And the interface should remain the same regardless of underlying algorithm
And I should see performance metrics for algorithm comparison
```

```gherkin
As a Production Engineer
I want to deploy ensemble detection with high reliability
So that I can achieve better accuracy than single algorithms

Given I have a critical production system requiring detection

Then the system should combine results intelligently
And provide confidence scores for each detection
And handle individual algorithm failures gracefully
And maintain sub-100ms response times

```gherkin
As a Data Quality Engineer
I want to automatically assess data quality across multiple dimensions
So that I can identify and prioritize quality improvement efforts

Given I have a dataset that needs quality assessment
When I run comprehensive quality validation
Then I should see quality scores for all dimensions
And I should see specific quality issues identified
And issues should be prioritized by business impact
And I should receive actionable remediation recommendations

## üìö Summary & Recommendations

### üéØ Key Findings

1. **15 Well-Defined Bounded Contexts** across 5 primary domains (AI, Data, Business, Software, Governance)
2. **100% Domain Boundary Compliance** with no violations detected
3. **Major Package Consolidation**: Anomaly Detection reduced from 118+ services to 3 core services (60%+ reduction)
4. **New Governance Domain**: Best practices framework for automated compliance validation
5. **Improved Domain Independence** with average independence score of 92.4%
6. **Proper ML/AI Separation**: Anomaly Detection moved to AI domain with ML integration delegation

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Strengths

- **Clean Architecture Implementation**: Clear separation between domain, application, and infrastructure layers
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Rich domain models with encapsulated business logic
- **Event-Driven Integration**: Loose coupling between bounded contexts through domain events
- **Self-Contained Packages**: High independence scores enabling autonomous development and deployment

### üîÑ Continuous Improvement

1. **Regular Boundary Validation**: Automated validation runs to maintain boundary integrity
2. **Domain Model Evolution**: Structured approach to evolving domain models
