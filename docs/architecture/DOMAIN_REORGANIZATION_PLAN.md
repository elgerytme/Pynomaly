# Domain Reorganization Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive reorganization of the repository into logical domains following domain-driven design principles. The goal is to improve code organization, reduce coupling, and create clearer boundaries between different business domains.

## Current Issues Addressed

1. **Scattered anomaly detection logic**: `pynomaly-detection/` package moved to standard `src/packages/data/anomaly_detection/` structure
2. **Overlapping responsibilities**: Multiple packages handling similar functionality (algorithms, core detection, mlops)
3. **Inconsistent package structure**: Some packages follow standards, others don't
4. **Mixed concerns**: Packages containing multiple unrelated domains

## New Domain Structure

### Primary Domains

## Package Dependencies

### Dependency Graph
```
Core Domain Layer:
â”œâ”€â”€ core (base domain logic)
â”œâ”€â”€ mathematics (statistical utilities)
â””â”€â”€ anomaly_detection (detection algorithms)

Application Layer:
â”œâ”€â”€ machine_learning â†’ core, anomaly_detection, data_platform
â”œâ”€â”€ people_ops â†’ core, infrastructure
â”œâ”€â”€ data_platform â†’ core, infrastructure
â”œâ”€â”€ services â†’ core, infrastructure
â””â”€â”€ enterprise â†’ core, infrastructure, services

Infrastructure Layer:
â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure â†’ core
â””â”€â”€ interfaces â†’ ALL (presentation layer)

Shared:
â”œâ”€â”€ testing (test utilities)
â””â”€â”€ pkg (third-party packages)
```

### Dependency Rules
1. **Domain packages** can only depend on other domain packages or core
2. **Application packages** can depend on domain and infrastructure
3. **Infrastructure packages** can depend on domain packages
4. **Presentation layer** can depend on all other layers
5. **No circular dependencies** allowed between packages
