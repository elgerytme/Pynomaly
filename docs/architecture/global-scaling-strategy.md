## Regional Distribution Strategy

### Traffic Distribution Model

| us-east-1 (Secondary) | Active Secondary | 30% | Load distribution, US East Coast users |
| eu-west-1 (Tertiary) | Disaster Recovery | 10% | European users, disaster recovery |

## Global Load Balancing & Routing

### Intelligent Traffic Routing

#### Route53 Health Checks & Failover
```yaml
Health Check Configuration:
  Primary Region:
    - Endpoint: primary-alb.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com
    - Check Interval: 30 seconds
    - Failure Threshold: 3 consecutive failures
    - Health Check Path: /health
    
  Secondary Region:
    - Endpoint: secondary-alb.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
    - Check Interval: 30 seconds
    - Failure Threshold: 3 consecutive failures
    - Health Check Path: /health
    
  Tertiary Region:
    - Endpoint: tertiary-alb.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com
    - Check Interval: 30 seconds
    - Failure Threshold: 3 consecutive failures
    - Health Check Path: /health

Routing Policies:
  1. Weighted Routing (Normal Operation):
     - Primary: 60% weight
     - Secondary: 30% weight
     - Tertiary: 10% weight
  
  2. Latency-Based Routing:
     - Route to lowest latency region for user
     - Fallback to health-based routing
  
  3. Geolocation Routing:
     - North America → Primary/Secondary
     - Europe → Tertiary
     - Asia-Pacific → Primary
     - Default → Primary

Failover Logic:
  1. If Primary fails → Secondary becomes primary (80%), Tertiary secondary (20%)
  2. If Secondary fails → Primary (80%), Tertiary (20%)
  3. If Tertiary fails → Primary (70%), Secondary (30%)
```

#### CloudFront CDN Configuration
```yaml
Distribution Settings:
  Price Class: PriceClass_All (global edge locations)
  Origins:
    - Primary: primary-alb.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com
    - Secondary: secondary-alb.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
    - Tertiary: tertiary-alb.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com
  
  Cache Behaviors:
    Static Assets: 24-hour TTL
    API Responses: No cache (TTL=0)
    Model Artifacts: 7-day TTL
    
  Origin Groups:
    Primary Group: Primary + Secondary (failover)
    Secondary Group: Tertiary (disaster recovery)
```

## Data Replication & Consistency

### Database Strategy (Aurora Global)

#### Global Cluster Configuration
```yaml
Aurora Global Database:
  Primary Region: us-west-2

    RPO (Recovery Point Objective): < 1 second
    
  Cross-Region Backup:
    Enabled: true
    Backup Region: us-east-2
    Retention: 90 days
```

#### Database Access Patterns
```yaml
Read/Write Split:
  Primary Region:
    - All writes
    - Local reads (60%)
  
  Secondary Region:
    - Read-only queries (30%)
    - Analytics workloads
  
  Tertiary Region:
    - Read-only queries (10%)
    - Reporting workloads
    - Disaster recovery standby
```

### Object Storage Strategy (S3)

    Models Bucket:
      - Replicate to us-east-1 (STANDARD)
      - Replicate to eu-west-1 (STANDARD_IA)
    
    Artifacts Bucket:
      - Replicate to us-east-1 (STANDARD)
      - No replication to eu-west-1 (disaster recovery only)

Lifecycle Policies:
  Data:
    - STANDARD (0-30 days)
    - STANDARD_IA (30-90 days)
    - GLACIER (90-365 days)
    - DEEP_ARCHIVE (365+ days)
  
  Models:
