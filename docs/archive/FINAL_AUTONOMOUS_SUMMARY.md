## 🔍 Algorithm Selection Intelligence

### How It Works

```python
# 1. Data Profiling (13+ characteristics)
profile = DataProfile(
    n_samples=10000,
    n_features=15,
    complexity_score=0.7,
    sparsity_ratio=0.05,
    correlation_score=0.4
)

# 2. Algorithm Scoring (compatibility-based)
for algorithm in available_algorithms:
    score = calculate_algorithm_score(algorithm, profile)
    # Factors: sample size, complexity match, feature support, etc.

# 3. Confidence-Based Selection
recommendations = top_algorithms_by_confidence(scores)
```
