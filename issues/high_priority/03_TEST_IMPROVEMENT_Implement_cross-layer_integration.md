# [TEST IMPROVEMENT] Implement cross-layer integration testing

**Labels**: test-improvement, high, integration, phase-2
**Assignees**: 
**Milestone**: Test Coverage Improvement - Phase 2

## Test Improvement Task

### Component Information
- **Component**: Cross-Layer Integration
- **Layer**: Integration
- **Area**: System Architecture
- **Current State**: Limited cross-layer boundary testing

### Task Description
Implement comprehensive cross-layer integration testing to validate boundaries and communication between architectural layers. Ensure proper separation of concerns and contract compliance.

### Scope
**Included:**
- [ ] Domain ↔ Application boundary testing
- [ ] Application ↔ Infrastructure integration
- [ ] Infrastructure ↔ Presentation integration
- [ ] Cross-service communication testing
- [ ] Contract validation between layers
- [ ] Error propagation testing

**Excluded:**
- [ ] Unit testing within layers
- [ ] End-to-end system testing
- [ ] Performance testing

#### Testing Approach
- **Test Type**: Integration
- **Framework**: pytest with dependency injection
- **Mocking Strategy**: Mock external boundaries, test internal integration
- **Data Strategy**: Realistic data flow testing

#### Specific Test Scenarios
- [ ] Layer boundary contract validation
- [ ] Data transformation between layers
- [ ] Error handling and propagation
- [ ] Service communication protocols
- [ ] Dependency injection validation
- [ ] Interface compliance testing

### Expected Outcomes
- **Coverage Improvement**: Comprehensive cross-layer integration coverage
- **Quality Metrics**: All layer boundaries validated
- **Architecture**: Clean architecture compliance verified

### Dependencies
- [ ] Architecture documentation
- [ ] Interface specifications
- [ ] Dependency injection framework
- [ ] Contract testing tools

### Definition of Done
- [ ] All layer boundaries tested
- [ ] Contract compliance validated
- [ ] Error propagation verified
- [ ] Service communication tested
- [ ] Integration points documented
- [ ] No architectural violations detected

### Effort Estimation
- **Complexity**: High
- **Estimated Time**: 2 weeks
- **Skills Required**: Clean architecture, integration testing, system design
