# [TEST COVERAGE] Missing system testing category - 0% coverage

**Labels**: test-coverage, critical, system-testing, phase-1
**Assignees**: 
**Milestone**: Test Coverage Improvement - Phase 1

## Test Coverage Gap Details

### Coverage Information
- **Area/Layer**: System Testing
- **Current Coverage**: 0% (No dedicated system test directory)
- **Target Coverage**: Complete system test suite
- **Gap Percentage**: 100%
- **Priority**: Critical

### Description
There is no dedicated system testing category, which means end-to-end system validation is missing. This creates significant risk for system integration failures and deployment issues.

### Impact Assessment
- **Business Impact**: System integration failures, deployment issues, poor system reliability
- **Technical Risk**: Component integration failures, system-level bugs, deployment problems
- **User Impact**: Complete system failures, unreliable user experience

### Affected Components
- [ ] End-to-end anomaly detection workflows
- [ ] Multi-component integration points
- [ ] System configuration and deployment
- [ ] Cross-service communication
- [ ] System performance under load
- [ ] Recovery and failover procedures

### Recommended Actions
- [ ] Create system testing framework and directory structure
- [ ] Implement end-to-end anomaly detection workflow tests
- [ ] Add system integration point validation
- [ ] Create deployment and configuration validation tests
- [ ] Implement system performance and load tests
- [ ] Add system recovery and failover tests

### Implementation Plan
- **Estimated Effort**: 2 weeks, 1 developer
- **Dependencies**: System understanding, test environment setup, deployment automation
- **Deliverables**:

  └── conftest.py
  ```

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] System test directory and framework created
- [ ] End-to-end workflows comprehensively tested
- [ ] System integration points validated
- [ ] Deployment scenarios covered
- [ ] Performance and load testing implemented
- [ ] Recovery and failover procedures tested
