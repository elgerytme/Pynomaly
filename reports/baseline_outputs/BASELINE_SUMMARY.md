# Pynomaly Baseline Test Suite Summary

## Environment Setup

- **Virtual Environment**: Created fresh virtual environment at `venv/`
- **Installation**: Installed Pynomaly with all optional extras using `pip install -e '.[all]'`
- **Python Version**: 3.12.3
- **Test Framework**: pytest 8.4.1 with pytest-cov 6.2.1

## Test Execution Results

### Initial Full Test Suite Attempts
- **Full test suite with `pytest -q`**: Failed due to import errors
- **Main issues encountered**:
  1. Missing dependencies (email-validator, hypothesis)
  2. Import errors in API modules (`get_container_simple` not defined)
  3. Missing business entities and continuous learning classes

### Successful Baseline Run
- **Command**: `pytest tests/domain/test_entities.py --cov=pynomaly --cov-report=term --cov-report=xml -q`
- **Result**: âœ… **11 tests passed**
- **Exit Code**: 0
- **Execution Time**: 46.51 seconds

### Coverage Results
- **Overall Coverage**: 6.37% (85,151 missed statements out of 92,558 total)
- **Coverage Files Generated**:
  - `.coverage` (binary coverage data)
  - `reports/coverage.xml` (XML report)

### Test Files That Passed
- `tests/domain/test_entities.py` - Core domain entity tests including:
  - TestDetector (3 tests)
  - TestDataset (4 tests)
  - TestAnomaly (2 tests)
  - TestDetectionResult (2 tests)

### Known Issues in Codebase
1. **Missing Dependencies**: email-validator, hypothesis
2. **Import Errors**: Several classes referenced in tests but not implemented:
   - `ContinuousLearning` from `pynomaly.domain.entities.continuous_learning`
   - `CostOptimization` from `pynomaly.domain.entities.cost_optimization`
   - `BusinessRuleViolation` from `pynomaly.domain.exceptions.base`
3. **API Dependencies**: `get_container_simple` function not defined
4. **Deprecation Warnings**: 37 warnings mostly related to:
   - Pydantic v2 migration issues
   - datetime.utcnow() deprecation
   - passlib crypt module deprecation

## Files Saved for Comparison
- `pytest_basic_baseline.log` - Successful test run output with coverage report
- `.coverage` - Binary coverage database
- `coverage.xml` - XML coverage report
- Multiple failed attempt logs for reference

## Recommendations for Next Steps
1. Fix import errors in missing business entities
2. Install missing dependencies (hypothesis for property-based testing)
3. Fix API dependency injection issues
4. Address deprecation warnings
5. Expand working test coverage beyond basic domain entities

## Notes
- The test suite shows the core domain entities are functional
- Most of the codebase is not covered due to import/dependency issues
- This baseline establishes a working foundation to build upon
