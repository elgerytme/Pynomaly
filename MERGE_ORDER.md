# Branch Merge Order Plan

## Objective
Process branches in order of highest value / lowest risk to keep trunk green during integration.

## Current Status
- **Main branch**: `75f8c820` - Latest merge from feature/c-004-container-security
- **Total branches to process**: 24 feature branches
- **Strategy**: Sequential rebase onto latest main, PR creation, CI validation, merge

## Priority-Based Merge Order

### Priority 1: Critical Infrastructure (Enables builds/CI)
**Rationale**: Must be merged first to ensure CI pipeline works for subsequent branches

1. **feature/fix-missing-dependencies**
   - Status: Local branch exists
   - Risk: Low (dependency fixes)
   - Impact: Enables builds for other branches

2. **upgrade-deps-specs**
   - Status: Local branch exists
   - Risk: Low (specification updates)
   - Impact: Ensures proper dependency management

### Priority 2: High Business Value
**Rationale**: Core business functionality with proven value

3. **feat/issue-32-high-priority-feature**
   - Status: Local branch exists, remote tracking
   - Risk: Medium (feature addition)
   - Impact: High business value
   - Note: Also has clean variant `feat/issue-32-high-priority-feature-clean`

### Priority 3: Security Enhancements
**Rationale**: Security improvements, need to deduplicate similar branches

4. **security-validation-enhancements** (PRIMARY)
   - Status: Local branch exists

   - Impact: Security hardening

5. **feature/security-validation-enhancements** (DUPLICATE - TO BE REVIEWED)
   - Status: Local branch exists with remote tracking
   - Action: Compare with primary branch, merge if different, otherwise delete

    - Impact: Windows compatibility

16. **feature/c-004-container-security**
    - Status: ✅ **ALREADY MERGED** (latest commit in main)
    - Action: Skip - already integrated

### Priority 7: Housekeeping & Cleanup
**Rationale**: Non-critical cleanup and organization

17. **feature/project-cleanup-2025-07**
    - Status: Local branch exists with remote tracking
    - Risk: Low (cleanup)
    - Impact: Code organization

18. **chore/backup-pre-refactor**
    - Status: Local branch exists with remote tracking
    - Risk: Low (backup)
    - Impact: Safety backup

19. **chore/organize-uncommitted-changes**
    - Status: Local branch exists with remote tracking
    - Risk: Low (organization)
    - Impact: Code organization

20. **feature/cleanup-folder-structure**
    - Status: Local branch exists
    - Risk: Medium (structural changes)
    - Impact: Project organization

### Additional Branches (Need Assessment)
**Rationale**: Branches that need evaluation for integration

21. **develop**
    - Status: Local branch exists with remote tracking
    - Risk: Unknown (depends on content)
    - Action: Evaluate content and determine integration path

22. **feat/issue-33-critical-bug-fix**
    - Status: Local branch exists
    - Risk: Medium (bug fix)
    - Impact: Critical bug resolution
    - Note: May need higher priority based on criticality

23. **feat/issue-5-core-architecture**
    - Status: Local branch exists with remote tracking
    - Risk: High (architecture changes)
    - Impact: Core system changes

24. **feat/issue-5-core-architecture-foundation**
    - Status: Local branch exists
    - Risk: High (architecture changes)
    - Impact: Foundation changes

## Execution Process

For each branch in order:

1. **Pre-merge checks**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout [branch-name]
   git rebase main
   ```

2. **Conflict resolution** (if needed)
   - Resolve merge conflicts
   - Test functionality
   - Commit resolution

3. **Quality assurance**
   - Run test suite
   - Check code quality
   - Verify no breaking changes

4. **PR creation and merge**
   - Create pull request
   - Wait for CI to pass
   - Merge after approval

5. **Post-merge cleanup**
   - Delete feature branch
   - Update local main
   - Proceed to next branch

## Special Considerations

### Duplicate Branch Handling
- **Security branches**: Compare `security-validation-enhancements` vs `feature/security-validation-enhancements`
- **Test coverage branches**: Review overlap between coverage-related branches
- **Issue-32 branches**: Choose between `feat/issue-32-high-priority-feature` and clean variant

### High-Risk Branches
- **Architecture branches**: `feat/issue-5-*` may need careful review
- **Structural changes**: `feature/cleanup-folder-structure` could affect multiple areas
- **Critical bug fixes**: `feat/issue-33-*` may need expedited processing

### Branch Dependencies
- Dependencies should be resolved first (Priority 1)
- Security enhancements should come before other features
- Documentation can be processed in parallel with development work
- Tests should be updated after feature integration

## Success Metrics
- ✅ Main branch remains green throughout process
- ✅ CI pipeline passes for each merge
- ✅ No regression in functionality
- ✅ All feature branches successfully integrated
- ✅ Clean git history maintained

## Risk Mitigation
- **Small, atomic merges**: One branch at a time
- **CI gate**: No merge without passing tests
- **Rollback plan**: Keep main branch stable for quick reversion
- **Communication**: Update team on progress and any issues

**Next Action**: Begin with Priority 1 branches (dependency fixes) to enable CI for subsequent merges.
