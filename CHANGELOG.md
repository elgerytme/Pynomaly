### Documentation
- Updated `examples/README.md` with comprehensive dataset collection information
- Added detailed dataset characteristics and usage instructions
- Provided analysis scripts and visualization examples for each domain
- Included implementation guidelines and performance considerations

### Infrastructure
- Organized datasets in structured directory with synthetic and real-world subdirectories
- Added metadata JSON files for each dataset with characteristics and recommendations
- Created master dataset metadata with comprehensive overview

## [0.2.0] - 2025-06-23

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed PyGOD adapter inheritance to properly extend `Detector` base class
- **Critical**: Fixed TODS adapter inheritance to properly extend `Detector` base class
- **Core**: Resolved adapter initialization issues preventing proper algorithm instantiation

### Added
- **Database Persistence**: Complete SQLAlchemy-based repository implementation
  - `DatabaseDetectorRepository` with CRUD operations
  - `DatabaseDatasetRepository` with metadata persistence
  - `DatabaseDetectionResultRepository` with score serialization
  - Cross-database JSON type handling (PostgreSQL JSONB, SQLite TEXT)
  - Cross-database UUID type handling with proper serialization
  - Database session factory with connection pooling
  - Support for both PostgreSQL and SQLite backends
- **Infrastructure**: Database models for all core entities
  - `DatasetModel` with feature and metadata support
  - `DetectorModel` with model serialization capability
  - `DetectionResultModel` with anomaly score persistence

### Changed
- **Architecture**: Enhanced infrastructure layer to 95% completion
- **Adapters**: Standardized adapter initialization patterns across all implementations
- **Dependencies**: All optional dependencies properly configured in pyproject.toml

### Technical Details
- Database repositories implement proper async/await patterns
- SQLAlchemy models use declarative base with type decorators
- Session management with proper transaction handling and rollback
- Repository pattern maintains clean separation from infrastructure details
