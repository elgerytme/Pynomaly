## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize the ML Pipeline System

```python
from mlops.infrastructure.pipeline.advanced_ml_pipeline import AdvancedMLPipeline
from mlops.infrastructure.model_registry.advanced_model_registry import AdvancedModelRegistry
from mlops.infrastructure.deployment.automated_ml_deployment import AutomatedMLDeployment

# Initialize components
pipeline = AdvancedMLPipeline()
registry = AdvancedModelRegistry()
deployment = AutomatedMLDeployment()

# Run complete pipeline
result = await pipeline.run_complete_pipeline(experiment_id="exp_001")
```

### 2. Register and Deploy Models

```python
# Register model with metadata
metadata = ModelMetadata(
    name="anomaly_detector_v2",
    version="1.0.0",
    algorithm="isolation_forest",
    framework="scikit-learn",
    created_by="ml-team",
    description="Enhanced anomaly detection model"
)

metrics = ModelMetrics(
    accuracy=0.94,
    precision=0.91,
    recall=0.89,
    f1_score=0.90,
    roc_auc=0.93
)

model_id = await registry.register_model(
    model_path="/models/anomaly_detector_v2.pkl",
    metadata=metadata,
    metrics=metrics
)

# Deploy with Blue-Green strategy
deployment_id = await deployment.deploy_model(
    model_id=model_id,
    version="1.0.0",
    environment="production",
    strategy=DeploymentStrategy.BLUE_GREEN
)
```

### 3. Set Up Pipeline Orchestration

```python
from mlops.orchestration.ml_pipeline_orchestrator import MLPipelineOrchestrator

orchestrator = MLPipelineOrchestrator()

# Register pipeline with schedule
await orchestrator.register_pipeline(
    name="daily_model_training",
    pipeline_config={
        "data_source": "production_logs",
        "model_type": "anomaly_detection",
        "validation_split": 0.2
    },
    schedule="0 2 * * *",  # Daily at 2 AM
    resource_requirements={"cpu": 4, "memory": "8Gi", "gpu": 1}
)

# Execute pipeline
execution_id = await orchestrator.execute_pipeline(
    pipeline_name="daily_model_training",
    trigger_type=TriggerType.SCHEDULED
)
```

## Deployment Strategies

### 1. Blue-Green Deployment
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Instant rollback capability
- Full traffic switch after validation

### 2. Canary Deployment
- Gradual traffic increase (5% â†’ 25% â†’ 50% â†’ 100%)
- Automated rollback on performance degradation
- Configurable success criteria

### 3. A/B Testing
- Automated A/B test setup and execution
- Statistical significance testing
- Performance comparison and winner selection

### 4. Shadow Deployment
- Production traffic duplication for testing
- Risk-free validation of new models
- Performance comparison without user impact

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics Tracked

1. **Pipeline Metrics**
   - Execution time and success rate
   - Data quality scores
   - Resource utilization

2. **Model Performance**
   - Prediction accuracy and latency
   - Drift detection and model degradation
   - A/B test performance comparison

3. **Infrastructure Metrics**
   - Container resource usage
   - Kubernetes cluster health
   - Database and storage performance

### Alert Conditions

```python
# Example alert configuration
alert_config = {
    "model_accuracy_drop": {
        "threshold": 0.05,  # 5% drop from baseline
        "evaluation_window": "1h",
        "severity": "critical"
    },
    "prediction_latency": {
        "threshold": 1000,  # 1 second
        "evaluation_window": "5m",
        "severity": "warning"
    },
    "pipeline_failure": {
        "consecutive_failures": 2,
        "severity": "critical"
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Pipeline Failures**
   - Check data availability and quality
   - Verify resource allocation and limits
   - Review logs for specific error messages

2. **Deployment Issues**
   - Validate model compatibility and dependencies
   - Check Kubernetes cluster resources
   - Verify network connectivity and permissions

3. **Performance Degradation**
   - Monitor data drift and feature importance changes
   - Check for infrastructure bottlenecks
   - Review recent pipeline or model changes

### Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check pipeline status
kubectl get pods -n ml-pipeline

# View orchestrator logs
kubectl logs -f deployment/ml-pipeline-orchestrator -n ml-pipeline
