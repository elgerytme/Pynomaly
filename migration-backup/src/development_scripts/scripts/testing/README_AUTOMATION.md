# Automated Test Coverage Analysis System
## Pynomaly Project

This directory contains a comprehensive automated system for analyzing test coverage, identifying gaps, and creating improvement plans with GitHub issues.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Run Complete Analysis
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root
cd /path/to/pynomaly

# Run the complete automated workflow
./scripts/testing/run_automated_analysis.sh
```

### Individual Components
```bash
# Run just the coverage analysis
python3 scripts/testing/automated_test_coverage_analysis.py --project-root .

# Run with actual test execution (slower but more accurate)
python3 scripts/testing/automated_test_coverage_analysis.py --project-root . --run-tests

# Create GitHub issues from analysis
python3 scripts/testing/create_github_issues.py --project-root .
```
