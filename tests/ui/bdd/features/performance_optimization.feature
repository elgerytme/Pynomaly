    And critical content should be prioritized
    And images should be optimized for the connection
    And graceful degradation should occur on slow networks
    And offline capabilities should work reliably

  Scenario: Memory Management
    Given I am using the application for extended periods

    And large objects should be properly cleaned up
    And the application should not slow down over time

  Scenario: Bundle Size Optimization
    Given the application assets are being loaded
    When I access different parts of the application
    Then JavaScript bundles should be optimized and split
    And code splitting should load only necessary code
    And unused code should not be included
    And compression should be applied effectively
    And caching strategies should be optimal

  Scenario: Database Query Performance
    Given I am performing data operations
    When I search, filter, or sort large datasets
    Then queries should execute quickly
    And pagination should be efficient
    And indexes should be properly utilized
    And query optimization should be in place
    And concurrent operations should not block each other

  Scenario: API Response Performance
    Given I am making API requests
    When I interact with the backend services
    Then API responses should be under 200ms for simple operations
    And complex operations should show progress indicators
    And concurrent requests should be handled efficiently
    And rate limiting should not impact normal usage
    And error responses should be fast

  Scenario: Caching Strategy Performance

    When I access previously loaded content
    Then cached content should load instantly
    And cache invalidation should work correctly
    And cache storage should be managed efficiently
    And different cache strategies should be optimized for content type
    And cache hit rates should be maximized

  Scenario: Performance Monitoring and Alerts
