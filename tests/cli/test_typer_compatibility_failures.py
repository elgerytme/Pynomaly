"""
Test suite to demonstrate Typer version compatibility issues and the root cause
of the AttributeError: 'Group' object has no attribute 'registered_commands'.

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
The error was NOT that Group objects lack 'registered_commands', but rather that
custom helper code in Pynomaly was written for an older version of Typer where
`registered_groups` was a dictionary, but in Typer ≥0.15.0 it became a list.

This test suite documents the current bad behavior and creates RED tests that
assert the failing behavior before fixing it.
