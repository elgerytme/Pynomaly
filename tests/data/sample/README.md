# Sample Data Directory

This subdirectory of `tests/data/` contains large binary samples and other significant files used for testing the Pynomaly suite.

## Guidelines

- This directory is intended for large test files that do not change frequently.
- Ensure these files are properly documented regarding their origin and intended test case.

## Usage

Sample data files can be accessed similarly to other test fixtures but are expected to be larger in size.
- Ensure efficient file handling in tests to avoid long execution times.
