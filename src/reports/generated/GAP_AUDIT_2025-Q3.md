# GAP Audit 2025-Q3

## Comprehensive Requirement & Gap Audit

### Overview
This report highlights the key gaps within the codebase regarding its feature claims versus actual implementations.

### Identified Gaps

#### Undocumented `NotImplementedError` Locations
1. **`src/anomaly_detection/application/services/model_persistence_service.py`** - ONNX serialization method throws `NotImplementedError`. Severity: **High**
2. **`src/anomaly_detection/infrastructure/adapters/pytorch_stub.py`** - Stub class methods for PyTorch models throw `ImportError`. Severity: **Critical**
3. **`src/anomaly_detection/infrastructure/adapters/tensorflow_stub.py`** - TensorFlow adapter lacks implementation. Severity: **Critical**
4. **`src/anomaly_detection/infrastructure/adapters/jax_stub.py`** - JAX adapter lacks implementation. Severity: **Critical**

#### Disabled/Partial CLI Commands
1. **`src/anomaly_detection/presentation/cli/app.py`** - Several commands temporarily disabled, including `security`, `dashboard`, and `governance`. Severity: **Medium**

#### Stub Adapters
1. **PyTorch Adapter** - Stub files located at `src/anomaly_detection/infrastructure/adapters/deep_learning/pytorch_stub.py`. Severity: **Critical**
2. **TensorFlow Adapter** - Stub files located at `src/anomaly_detection/infrastructure/adapters/deep_learning/tensorflow_stub.py`. Severity: **Critical**
3. **JAX Adapter** - Stub files located at `src/anomaly_detection/infrastructure/adapters/deep_learning/jax_stub.py`. Severity: **Critical**

#### Documentation Claims Not Met by Code
1. **AutoML Claims** - Mentioned in the README as available but primarily stub implementations. Severity: **High**
2. **Explainability** - SHAP/LIME mentioned as supported but requires additional dependencies. Severity: **Medium**
3. **Deep Learning** - Claimed integration exists only as stubs. Severity: **Critical**
4. **PWA Features** - Basic implementations only, not production-ready. Severity: **Medium**
