## Benefits of Simplification

1. **Reduced Complexity:** From {len(analysis['keep']) + len(analysis['remove']) + len(analysis['unified'])} workflows to 3 unified workflows
2. **Better Maintainability:** Centralized CI/CD logic in fewer files
3. **Improved Performance:** Optimized caching and parallel execution
4. **Clearer Responsibilities:** Separate workflows for CI, CD, and maintenance
5. **Reduced Duplication:** Eliminated redundant configurations

## Next Steps

1. Test the unified workflows thoroughly
2. Remove the temporary workflows after validation
3. Update documentation to reflect the new structure
4. Train team members on the new simplified workflows

## Rollback Instructions

If needed, workflows can be restored from: `{backup_dir}`

```bash
# To restore a specific workflow
cp {backup_dir}/[workflow-name].yml .github/workflows/

# To restore all workflows
cp {backup_dir}/*.yml .github/workflows/
```
