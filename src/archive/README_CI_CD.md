### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pynomaly/pynomaly.git
cd pynomaly
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev,test,lint]"
```

3. **Run quality checks:**
```bash
./scripts/ci/quality-check.py --install-deps
```

4. **Run tests:**
```bash
./scripts/ci/test-runner.py --suites unit integration
```

5. **Run full CI pipeline:**
```bash
./scripts/ci/run-ci-pipeline.sh
```

### GitHub Actions Setup

The CI/CD pipeline is automatically triggered by GitHub Actions. No additional setup is required for basic functionality.

**Environment Variables:**
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Automatically provided by GitHub
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` - For deployment notifications (optional)

**Secrets:**
- `DOCKER_REGISTRY_TOKEN` - For container registry access
- `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY` - For deployment access (if using SSH)
