# [TEST COVERAGE] Critical gap in CLI testing - Only 9.1% coverage

**Labels**: test-coverage, critical, cli, phase-1
**Assignees**: 
**Milestone**: Test Coverage Improvement - Phase 1

## Test Coverage Gap Details

### Coverage Information
- **Area/Layer**: CLI (Command Line Interface)
- **Current Coverage**: 9.1% (4 test files / 44 source files)
- **Target Coverage**: 60%
- **Gap Percentage**: 50.9%
- **Priority**: Critical

### Description
The CLI is a major user interface for Pynomaly with severely inadequate test coverage. Only 4 test files exist for 44 source files, creating significant risk for user-facing functionality.

### Impact Assessment
- **Business Impact**: CLI failures could block user workflows and adoption
- **Technical Risk**: Untested command parsing, validation, and execution logic
- **User Impact**: Poor user experience, unreliable command execution

### Affected Components
- [ ] Command-specific implementations (detect, train, autonomous, dataset, export)
- [ ] CLI argument validation and parsing
- [ ] Configuration file processing
- [ ] Help system and documentation
- [ ] Error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Output formatting and export functionality

### Recommended Actions
- [ ] Create comprehensive command-specific test suites
- [ ] Implement CLI workflow integration tests
- [ ] Add argument validation and error handling tests
- [ ] Create help system and documentation validation tests
- [ ] Add configuration file processing tests
- [ ] Implement output formatting validation tests

### Implementation Plan
- **Estimated Effort**: 3 weeks, 1 developer
- **Dependencies**: CLI framework understanding, test data creation
- **Deliverables**:

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CLI coverage > 60%
- [ ] All major commands have comprehensive tests
- [ ] Workflow integration tests pass
- [ ] Help system validation complete
- [ ] Error handling and edge cases covered
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
