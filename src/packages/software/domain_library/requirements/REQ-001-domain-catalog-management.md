# REQ-001: Domain Catalog Management

## Overview
The Domain Library package must provide comprehensive catalog management capabilities for organizing and maintaining domain entities across business contexts.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-001.1: Entity Cataloging
- **Given** a domain entity with valid metadata
- **When** the entity is added to the catalog
- **Then** it should be stored with unique identification
- **And** it should be retrievable by ID, name, or category

### FR-001.2: Category Management
- **Given** a set of domain entities
- **When** organizing entities by business domain
- **Then** categories should support hierarchical organization
- **And** entities should be assignable to multiple categories

### FR-001.3: Search and Discovery
- **Given** a populated domain catalog
- **When** searching for entities by criteria
- **Then** results should support filtering by metadata, tags, and relationships
- **And** search should be performant for large catalogs (>10,000 entities)

### FR-001.4: Version Management
- **Given** an existing domain entity
- **When** the entity definition is updated
- **Then** version history should be maintained
- **And** backward compatibility should be preserved for API consumers

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-001.1: Performance
- Catalog searches must complete within 100ms for datasets up to 10,000 entities
- Entity retrieval by ID must complete within 10ms

### NFR-001.2: Scalability
- Support for up to 50,000 domain entities per catalog
- Horizontal scaling through catalog partitioning

### NFR-001.3: Data Integrity
- All entity relationships must maintain referential integrity
- Catalog operations must be ACID-compliant

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Catalog Creation**: Successfully create new domain catalogs with metadata
2. **Entity Management**: Add, update, delete, and retrieve domain entities
3. **Search Functionality**: Full-text and metadata-based search capabilities
4. **Performance Benchmarks**: Meet specified response time requirements
5. **Data Validation**: Enforce entity schema validation and business rules

## Dependencies
- Core domain entities (EntityId, VersionNumber, EntityMetadata)
- Repository pattern implementation for persistence
- Search indexing infrastructure

## Priority: High
## Effort Estimate: 8 story points
## Target Sprint: Sprint 1
