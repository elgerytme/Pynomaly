## Enforcement

### Reporting Process

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

**How to Report:**
- **General Issues**: Contact project maintainers via GitHub issues or discussions
- **Sensitive Matters**: Email the interfaces team leadership directly
- **Accessibility Concerns**: Use accessibility-specific reporting channels
- **Urgent Situations**: Contact multiple maintainers or escalate through organizational channels

**What to Include:**
- Description of the incident and its impact on users or community
- Relevant timestamps and communication records
- Interface components or user experiences affected
- Any immediate usability or accessibility concerns
- Suggested remediation steps if applicable

### Response Process

Community leaders will follow these steps when addressing violations:

1. **Acknowledgment**: Confirm receipt of report within 24 hours
2. **Investigation**: Review the incident and assess user impact
3. **Assessment**: Determine appropriate response based on severity and scope
4. **Action**: Implement corrective measures as outlined below
5. **Follow-up**: Monitor the situation and provide ongoing support as needed

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these guidelines in determining consequences:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the interface development community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions, including minor violations of accessibility guidelines or interface standards.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including creating inaccessible interfaces or significantly degrading user experience.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals, or severe compromise of user accessibility or interface quality.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

### Special Considerations for Interfaces

**Accessibility Violations:**
