## Enforcement

### Reporting Process

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

**How to Report:**
- **General Issues**: Contact project maintainers via GitHub issues or discussions
- **Sensitive Matters**: Email the core team leadership directly
- **Architecture Concerns**: Use architecture review processes for technical disagreements
- **Urgent Situations**: Contact multiple maintainers or escalate through organizational channels

**What to Include:**
- Description of the incident and its impact on the codebase or community
- Relevant timestamps and communication records
- Code or architecture components affected
- Any immediate quality or maintainability concerns
- Suggested remediation steps if applicable

### Response Process

Community leaders will follow these steps when addressing violations:

1. **Acknowledgment**: Confirm receipt of report within 24 hours
2. **Investigation**: Review the incident and assess architectural or code quality impact
3. **Assessment**: Determine appropriate response based on severity and scope
4. **Action**: Implement corrective measures as outlined below
5. **Follow-up**: Monitor the situation and provide ongoing support as needed

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these guidelines in determining consequences:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the software architecture community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions, including minor violations of architectural principles or coding standards.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including significant violations of Clean Architecture principles or deliberately introducing technical debt.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals, or severe compromise of code quality and architectural integrity.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

### Special Considerations for Core Package

**Architecture Violations:**
- Immediate review of all contributions that violate Clean Architecture principles
- Architectural refactoring required to restore proper layer separation
- Enhanced code review requirements for future contributions

**Domain Boundary Violations:**
- Assessment of impact on domain purity and business logic integrity
- Remediation plan to restore proper domain modeling
- Additional training on Domain-Driven Design principles

**Quality Degradation:**
- Comprehensive review of test coverage and code quality metrics
- Implementation of additional quality gates and review processes
- Documentation of lessons learned and prevention strategies

## Appeals Process

Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated under this Code of Conduct may appeal decisions by:

1. **Formal Appeal**: Submit a written appeal to the core team leadership within 30 days
2. **External Review**: Request review by an independent architectural expert for serious matters
3. **Documentation**: Provide additional context or evidence not previously considered
4. **Mediation**: Participate in mediated discussions to resolve architectural disagreements
