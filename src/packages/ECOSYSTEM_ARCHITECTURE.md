## Architectural Principles

### 1. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

Each package represents a bounded context with clear domain boundaries:

```
src/packages/
â”œâ”€â”€ ai/                    # Artificial Intelligence domain
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ machine_learning/  # Core ML algorithms and models
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mlops/            # ML operations and lifecycle management
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ neuro_symbolic/   # Advanced AI techniques
â”œâ”€â”€ data/                 # Data management domain  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ anomaly_detection/ # Anomaly detection specialization
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data_quality/     # Data quality assurance

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ transformation/   # Data transformation pipelines
â”œâ”€â”€ enterprise/           # Enterprise-grade features
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ security/         # Authentication & authorization
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ governance/       # Compliance & audit
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ scalability/      # Performance & scaling
â””â”€â”€ integrations/         # External system integrations
    â”œâ”€â”€ cloud/            # Multi-cloud support
    â”œâ”€â”€ monitoring/       # Observability integrations
    â””â”€â”€ storage/          # Storage system adapters
```

### 2. Hexagonal Architecture

Each package follows hexagonal architecture patterns:

```
package/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/package_name/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ domain/           # Business logic & entities
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ application/      # Use cases & services  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure/   # External adapters
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ api/             # Interface adapters
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/               # Comprehensive test coverage
â””â”€â”€ docs/               # Package documentation
```

## Standardization Framework

### Package Configuration Standards

All packages follow consistent `pyproject.toml` structure:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling>=1.21.0"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[project]
name = "package-name"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Clear, concise package description"
requires-python = ">=3.11"

# Standardized dependencies
dependencies = [
    "pydantic>=2.0.0",
    "structlog>=23.0.0", 
    "fastapi>=0.104.0",
    # Domain-specific dependencies
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [...]      # Development tools
test = [...]     # Testing dependencies  
docs = [...]     # Documentation tools
security = [...] # Security scanning
monitoring = [...] # Observability tools
```

### Testing Standards

Comprehensive testing approach with consistent markers:

```python
# Test markers for categorization
@pytest.mark.unit         # Unit tests
@pytest.mark.integration  # Integration tests  
@pytest.mark.e2e         # End-to-end tests
@pytest.mark.performance # Performance tests
@pytest.mark.security    # Security tests
@pytest.mark.slow        # Long-running tests
```
