# Archive Package

This package contains archived and legacy components that are no longer actively maintained but are kept for reference and backward compatibility.

## Contents

This archive contains:

- **Legacy Implementations**: Previous versions of components that have been refactored or replaced
- **Deprecated Features**: Features that are no longer supported but maintained for compatibility
- **Reference Code**: Historical implementations that serve as examples or references
- **Migration Utilities**: Tools to help migrate from legacy components to current implementations

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Archive Components

- **Legacy System Integration**: When integrating with systems that depend on older interfaces
- **Migration Scenarios**: During gradual migration from old to new implementations
- **Reference Implementation**: When studying historical approaches to solved problems
- **Backward Compatibility**: When maintaining compatibility with existing deployments

### Migration Path

If you're using archived components, consider migrating to current implementations:

1. **Identify Current Equivalent**: Find the current package that replaces the archived functionality
2. **Review Migration Guide**: Check for migration documentation in the current package
3. **Test Compatibility**: Ensure the new implementation meets your requirements
4. **Plan Migration**: Create a migration plan with appropriate testing and rollback procedures

## Archived Components

*Note: Specific archived components will be documented here as they are moved to the archive.*

## Support Policy

- **No Active Development**: Archived components receive no new features or improvements
- **Critical Security Fixes**: Security vulnerabilities may be addressed on a case-by-case basis
- **Community Support**: Community members may provide support, but no official support is guaranteed
- **Documentation**: Documentation is preserved as-is from the time of archival

## Contributing

- **Bug Reports**: Critical bugs may be reported but fixes are not guaranteed
- **Migration Contributions**: Contributions to migration guides and utilities are welcome
- **Documentation**: Improvements to archive documentation are accepted
