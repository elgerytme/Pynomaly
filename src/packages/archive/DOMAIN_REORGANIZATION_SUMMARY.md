- `data/data_observability/` - Data lineage, pipeline health, predictive quality

### **Software Domain** (`software/`)
**Purpose**: Core Architecture, Interfaces, and Application Services
- `software/core/` - Clean Architecture foundation and domain logic
- `software/interfaces/` - REST APIs, CLI, Web UI, SDKs
- `software/services/` - Application services layer
- `software/enterprise/` - Enterprise-grade features
- `software/mobile/` - Mobile adaptations  
- `software/domain_library/` - Domain management templates

### **Ops Domain** (`ops/`)
**Purpose**: Operations, Infrastructure, and DevOps
- `ops/infrastructure/` - External integrations and adapters
- `ops/config/` - Configuration management
- `ops/people_ops/` - User management and authentication
- `ops/testing/` - Testing infrastructure and utilities

### **Formal Sciences Domain** (`formal_sciences/`)
**Purpose**: Mathematical and Logical Foundations
- `formal_sciences/mathematics/` - Statistical analysis and mathematical computing

### **Creative Domain** (`creative/`)
**Purpose**: Documentation and Content Management
- `creative/documentation/` - All documentation, training materials, guides

## ✅ **Key Accomplishments**

### **1. Domain Separation**
- Clear boundaries between AI, Data, Software, Ops, Formal Sciences, and Creative domains
- Each domain can evolve independently while maintaining clean interfaces
- Team ownership aligned with domain expertise

### **2. Dependency Architecture**
- Maintained Clean Architecture principles throughout reorganization
- `software/core` remains dependency-free foundation
- Domain dependencies flow correctly (no circular dependencies)
- Infrastructure adapters properly isolated

### **3. Build System Optimization**
- **Domain-specific Buck2 targets**: `build-ai`, `build-data`, `build-software`, `build-ops`
- **Test organization by domain**: `test-ai`, `test-data`, `test-software`, `test-ops`
- **Incremental build optimization** with domain impact analysis
- **Parallel build capability** for independent domains

### **4. Import Statement Updates**
Updated import patterns across codebase:
```python
# OLD → NEW
from core.* → from software.core.*
from infrastructure.* → from ops.infrastructure.*
from interfaces.* → from software.interfaces.*
from anomaly_detection.* → from ai.anomaly_detection.*
from data_platform.* → from data.data_platform.*
```

### **5. Package Consolidation**
- **Resolved duplication**: Merged `data-platform` into `data_platform`
- **Eliminated redundancy**: Single source of truth for each domain
- **Clean integration**: Data platform integration layer properly consolidated

## 🔧 **Technical Benefits**

### **Build Performance**
- **Domain-parallel builds**: Teams can build only their domain
- **Faster CI/CD**: Incremental builds based on domain changes
- **Selective testing**: Run tests for affected domains only

### **Team Productivity**
- **Domain ownership**: Clear responsibility boundaries
- **Independent development**: Minimal cross-domain conflicts
- **Focused expertise**: Teams can specialize in their domain

### **Maintainability**
- **Logical organization**: Packages grouped by business purpose
- **Easier navigation**: Developers can quickly find relevant code
- **Cleaner dependencies**: Well-defined domain interfaces

### **Scalability**
- **Growth accommodation**: New packages easily fit into existing domains
- **New domain addition**: Framework supports additional domains
- **Team scaling**: Domain structure supports team growth

## 📋 **Domain Responsibilities**

| Domain | Primary Focus | Key Packages | Team Ownership |
|--------|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| **AI** | ML/AI Operations | algorithms, anomaly_detection, mlops | ML/AI Engineers |
| **Data** | Data Processing | data_platform, data_observability | Data Engineers |
| **Software** | Core Architecture | core, interfaces, services | Platform Engineers |
| **Ops** | Operations/Infrastructure | infrastructure, testing, tools | DevOps/SRE |
| **Formal Sciences** | Mathematical Foundation | mathematics | Research/Data Scientists |
| **Creative** | Documentation/Content | documentation | Technical Writers |

## 🚀 **Future Expansion Framework**
