# REQ-003: Entity Relationships

## Overview
The Domain Library must support complex relationships between domain entities, enabling rich domain models that reflect real-world business connections and dependencies.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-003.1: Relationship Types
- **Given** two or more domain entities
- **When** establishing relationships between them
- **Then** the system should support multiple relationship types:
  - One-to-One (1:1)
  - One-to-Many (1:N)
  - Many-to-Many (M:N)
  - Hierarchical (Parent-Child)
  - Compositional (Whole-Part)

### FR-003.2: Bidirectional Navigation
- **Given** entities with established relationships
- **When** navigating from one entity to related entities
- **Then** navigation should work in both directions
- **And** relationship metadata should be preserved

### FR-003.3: Relationship Constraints
- **Given** a relationship definition with business rules
- **When** creating or modifying relationships
- **Then** constraints should be enforced (cardinality, referential integrity)
- **And** violations should be reported with clear error messages

### FR-003.4: Relationship Lifecycle
- **Given** established entity relationships
- **When** entities are updated or deleted
- **Then** dependent relationships should be handled appropriately
- **And** cascade operations should respect business rules

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-003.1: Performance
- Relationship traversal must complete within 20ms for depth â‰¤ 5
- Relationship queries must support pagination for large result sets

### NFR-003.2: Integrity
- All relationships must maintain referential integrity
- Orphaned relationships must be prevented or cleaned up automatically

### NFR-003.3: Scalability
- Support for graphs with up to 100,000 entities and 500,000 relationships
- Efficient storage and indexing of relationship data

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Relationship Modeling**: Support all required relationship types
2. **Navigation API**: Efficient bidirectional relationship traversal
3. **Constraint Enforcement**: Robust validation of relationship rules
4. **Performance Benchmarks**: Meet specified query response times
5. **Data Integrity**: Maintain consistency during all operations

## BDD Scenarios

### Scenario: Creating One-to-Many Relationship
```gherkin
Given a Customer entity and multiple Order entities
When I create a one-to-many relationship "Customer has Orders"
Then the customer should reference all associated orders
And each order should reference its parent customer
```

### Scenario: Enforcing Cardinality Constraints
```gherkin
Given a one-to-one relationship "Person has Passport"
When I attempt to assign a second passport to a person
Then the system should reject the assignment
And provide a clear constraint violation message
```

### Scenario: Cascade Delete Operations
```gherkin
Given a Customer with multiple Orders in a composition relationship
When I delete the Customer entity
Then all associated Orders should be deleted
And no orphaned order records should remain
```

## Dependencies
- Domain entity framework (EntityId, validation)
- Graph storage and traversal algorithms
- Constraint validation engine

## Priority: High
## Effort Estimate: 21 story points
## Target Sprint: Sprint 2-3
