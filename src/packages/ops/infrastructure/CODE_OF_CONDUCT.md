## Enforcement

### Reporting Process

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

**How to Report:**
- **General Issues**: Contact project maintainers via GitHub issues or discussions
- **Sensitive Matters**: Email the infrastructure team leadership directly
- **Security Incidents**: Use the security reporting process outlined in SECURITY.md
- **Infrastructure Emergencies**: Contact the on-call infrastructure team immediately

**What to Include:**
- Description of the incident and its impact on infrastructure or community
- Relevant timestamps and communication records
- Infrastructure systems or environments affected
- Any immediate security or operational concerns
- Suggested remediation steps if applicable

### Response Process

Community leaders will follow these steps when addressing violations:

1. **Acknowledgment**: Confirm receipt of report within 24 hours
2. **Investigation**: Review the incident and assess infrastructure impact
3. **Assessment**: Determine appropriate response based on severity and scope
4. **Action**: Implement corrective measures as outlined below
5. **Follow-up**: Monitor the situation and provide ongoing support as needed

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these guidelines in determining consequences:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the infrastructure community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions, including minor infrastructure misconfigurations or procedural violations.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including compromising infrastructure security or causing service disruptions.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Access to infrastructure systems may also be suspended. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals, or severe compromise of infrastructure systems.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community and permanent revocation of access to infrastructure systems and resources.

### Special Considerations for Infrastructure

**Security Violations:**
- Immediate revocation of access to production and sensitive infrastructure
- Security review of all infrastructure contributions from the violator
- Potential legal action for severe security breaches or data exposure

**Service Disruption:**
- Immediate investigation and restoration of affected infrastructure services
- Review of access permissions and audit logs across all infrastructure systems
- Enhanced monitoring and security measures to prevent future incidents

**Cost Impact Violations:**
- Immediate review and potential termination of expensive or unauthorized resources
- Assessment of financial impact and potential cost recovery measures
- Implementation of enhanced cost controls and approval processes

## Appeals Process

Individuals who believe they have been unfairly treated under this Code of Conduct may appeal decisions by:

1. **Formal Appeal**: Submit a written appeal to the infrastructure team leadership within 30 days
2. **External Review**: Request review by an independent third party for serious infrastructure matters
