# Security Policy - Anomaly Detection Package

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take the security of the Anomaly Detection package seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: security@example.com

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Status Updates**: Weekly until resolution
- **Fix and Disclosure**: Coordinated responsible disclosure

## Security Best Practices

When contributing to the Anomaly Detection package:

### Data Security
- **Input Validation**: Always validate input data and parameters
- **Sanitization**: Sanitize data before processing or storage
- **Memory Management**: Prevent memory leaks with large datasets
- **Temporary Files**: Securely handle temporary files and cleanup

### Algorithm Security
- **Randomness**: Use cryptographically secure random number generation when needed
- **Side-Channel Attacks**: Be aware of timing attacks in algorithm implementations
- **Model Poisoning**: Validate training data to prevent model poisoning attacks
- **Adversarial Examples**: Consider robustness against adversarial inputs

### Dependencies
- **Dependency Updates**: Keep dependencies updated for security patches
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regularly scan for known vulnerabilities
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Use minimal necessary dependencies
- **Trusted Sources**: Only use dependencies from trusted sources

### Infrastructure
- **Secrets Management**: Never hardcode secrets or credentials
- **Environment Variables**: Use secure environment variable management
- **Logging**: Avoid logging sensitive information
- **Error Messages**: Don't expose internal system details in error messages

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Known Security Considerations

### Model Training
- Training on untrusted data may lead to model poisoning
- Large datasets may cause memory exhaustion
- Unsupervised nature means validation is challenging

### Inference
- Adversarial examples may fool detection algorithms
- Resource exhaustion attacks through large inputs
- Side-channel information leakage through timing

## Security Tools

We recommend using these tools during development:

```bash
# Dependency vulnerability scanning
pip-audit

# Static security analysis
bandit -r src/

# Secrets detection
detect-secrets scan --all-files
```

## Updates

This security policy is regularly reviewed and updated. Check for the latest version when contributing.
