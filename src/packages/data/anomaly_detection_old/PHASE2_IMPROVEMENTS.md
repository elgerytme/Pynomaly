   from simplified_services.core_detection_service import CoreDetectionService
   ```

2. **Enhanced Capabilities**: Leverage new features
   ```python
   # Model persistence
   from enhanced_features.model_persistence import ModelPersistence
   
   # Advanced explanations
   from enhanced_features.advanced_explainability import AdvancedExplainability
