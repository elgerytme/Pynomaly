- **[data_studio/](data_studio/)** - Interactive data exploration and analysis tools

## Architecture Principles

All data domain packages follow these principles:

- **Domain Isolation**: No dependencies on AI or Enterprise domains
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation of domain, application, infrastructure, and presentation layers
- **Single Responsibility**: Each package focuses on one specific data concern
- **Configurable Integration**: External integrations handled through configuration packages

## Usage

```python
# Example: Data quality monitoring
from src.packages.data.data_quality.application.services import DataQualityService

quality_service = DataQualityService()
report = quality_service.assess_data_quality(dataset)

# Example: Data lineage tracking
from src.packages.data.observability.application.services import LineageService

lineage_service = LineageService()
lineage = lineage_service.track_data_lineage(data_source, transformations)
```

## Contributing

When contributing to data domain packages:

1. Ensure no dependencies on other domains (ai/, enterprise/)
2. Follow the standard package structure (domain/, application/, infrastructure/, presentation/)
3. Include comprehensive tests and documentation
4. Respect data domain boundaries and responsibilities
