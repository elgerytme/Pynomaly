Here's an implementation plan for the
  data_management package, adhering to
  Clean Hexagonal Architecture and
  Domain-Driven Design (DDD):


  I. Domain Layer (`src/packages/data/da
  ta_management/domain`)
   * Purpose: Encapsulate core business
     logic, independent of external
     concerns.
   * Content:
       * models.py: Define immutable
         (using frozen=True dataclasses
         and Pydantic) Entities (e.g.,
         DataAsset, Dataset), Value 
         Objects (e.g., DataLocation,
         DataQualityScore), and
         Aggregates (e.g.,
         DataCatalogEntry as an
         aggregate root for DataAsset
         and related DataQualityScore).
       * services.py: Implement Domain 
         Services for business logic
         that spans multiple entities
         or doesn't naturally fit
         within an entity (e.g.,
         DataValidationService,
         DataClassificationService).
       * events.py: Define Domain 
         Events (e.g.,
         DataAssetRegistered,
         DataQualityUpdated) to signal
         changes within the domain.
       * repositories.py: Define
         Abstract Repository Interfaces
         (e.g., IDataAssetRepository)
         for data persistence
         operations. These are contracts
          the infrastructure layer will
         implement.


  II. Application Layer (`src/packages/d
  ata/data_management/application`)
   * Purpose: Orchestrate domain
     objects to fulfill specific use
     cases. Depends on the Domain
     Layer.
   * Content:
       * commands.py: Define Command
         objects (e.g.,
         RegisterDataAssetCommand,
         UpdateDataQualityCommand)
         representing user intentions.
       * queries.py: Define Query
         objects (e.g.,
         GetDataAssetByIdQuery,
         ListDataAssetsQuery) for
         retrieving data.
       * handlers.py: Implement Command 
         Handlers and Query Handlers.
         These use domain services and
         repository interfaces to
         execute use cases. They should
         contain no business logic.
       * services.py: Application 
         Services that orchestrate the
         flow of commands/queries,
         interacting with domain
         objects and repositories.



  III. Infrastructure Layer 
  (`src/packages/data/data_management/i
  nfrastructure`)
   * Purpose: Implement external
     concerns and persistence. Depends
     on the Domain Layer (to implement
     its interfaces).
   * Content:
       * data_sources.py: Provide
         concrete implementations of
         the Repository Interfaces
         defined in the domain (e.g.,
         SQLDataAssetRepository,
         S3DataLocationService).
       * clients.py: Implement clients
         for external systems (e.g., a
         data catalog API client, a
         messaging queue producer).
       * persistence.py: Database
         connection setup, ORM
         configuration, etc.
       * messaging.py: Concrete
         implementations for
         publishing/consuming domain
         events.


  IV. Presentation Layer (`src/packages/
  data/data_management/presentation`)
   * Purpose: Handle user interaction
     and expose application
     functionality. Depends on the
     Application Layer.
   * Content:
       * api.py: FastAPI endpoints for a
          REST API, defining
         request/response schemas using
         Pydantic DTOs (Data Transfer
         Objects).
       * cli.py: Click commands for a
         command-line interface.
       * dtos.py: Pydantic models for
         data transfer between the
         presentation and application
         layers.



  V. Cross-Cutting Concerns & Best 
  Practices:
   * Dependency Injection: Use a robust
     DI framework (e.g.,
     dependency_injector) to manage
     dependencies between layers,
     especially for injecting repository
      implementations into application
     handlers.
   * Error Handling: Implement a
     consistent error handling strategy
     across all layers, translating
     infrastructure exceptions into
     domain-specific errors.
   * Logging: Utilize structlog for
     structured, context-rich logging.
   * Testing:
       * Unit Tests: Focus on domain
         models, services, and
         application handlers (mocking
         repository interfaces).
       * Integration Tests: Verify the
         interaction between
         application services and
         concrete infrastructure
         implementations.
       * End-to-End Tests: Test the
         full flow through the
         presentation layer (API/CLI).
   * Code Quality: Adhere to
     pyproject.toml standards (Black,
     isort, Ruff, MyPy) for formatting,
     linting, and type hinting.
