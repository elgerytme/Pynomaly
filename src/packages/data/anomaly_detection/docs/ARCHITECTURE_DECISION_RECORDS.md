│   └── mlops/               # Model lifecycle and experiment tracking  
├── 📊 Data Domain
│   └── processing/          # Data entities and processing pipelines
├── 🔧 Shared Infrastructure
│   ├── infrastructure/      # Configuration, logging, security
│   └── observability/       # Monitoring, metrics, dashboards
└── 🎯 Application Layer      # Anomaly detection business logic
```

### Decision

Implement a **5-phase migration approach**:

1. **Phase 1:** Domain structure planning and boundary definition
2. **Phase 2:** File organization and initial domain separation
3. **Phase 3:** Import dependency resolution with fallback patterns
4. **Phase 4:** Comprehensive testing and validation
5. **Phase 5:** Documentation and developer enablement

**Date:** July 24, 2025  
**Deciders:** Architecture Team  

### Context

The existing service layer provided valuable abstractions that users depended on.

### Decision

Preserve the existing service layer interfaces while reorganizing the underlying implementation across domains:

- `DetectionService` remains the primary interface
- `EnsembleService` for multi-algorithm coordination
- `StreamingService` for real-time processing
- Internal implementations redistributed across appropriate domains

### Consequences

#### Positive
- ✅ Familiar interfaces for existing users
- ✅ Stable API contracts
- ✅ Easier testing and validation

#### Negative
- ⚠️ Some services span multiple domains
- ⚠️ Requires careful dependency management

**Deciders:** Development Team  

### Context

Moving components across domains would break existing imports. We needed a strategy to handle this transition.

### Decision

Implement **try/except fallback patterns** for all cross-domain imports:

```python
try:
    # Try new domain-aware import
    from ai.mlops.domain.services.mlops_service import MLOpsService
except ImportError:
    # Fallback to existing location
    from anomaly_detection.domain.services.mlops_service import MLOpsService
```

### Consequences
