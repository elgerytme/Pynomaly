## 🏗️ New Domain Architecture

### **Before Migration: Monolithic Structure**
```

└── src/anomaly_detection/
    ├── domain/
    ├── infrastructure/
    ├── application/
    └── [everything mixed together]
```

### **After Migration: Domain-Separated Architecture**
```
src/packages/
├── core/anomaly_detection/domain/entities/     # Core business entities
├── ai/machine_learning/                        # ML algorithms & operations  
├── ai/mlops/                                  # Model lifecycle & experiments
├── data/processing/                           # Data processing & validation
├── shared/infrastructure/                     # Common infrastructure utilities
└── shared/observability/                      # Monitoring & observability
