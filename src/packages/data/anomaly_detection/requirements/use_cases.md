7. System delivers report via specified channel (email, dashboard, file)
8. User reviews report and shares with stakeholders

#### Alternative Flows

**A1: Scheduled Reports**
- 1a. User configures automatic report generation schedule
- 1b. System generates reports according to schedule
- 1c. System automatically delivers to configured recipients

**A2: Interactive Dashboard**
- 6a. User requests interactive dashboard instead of static report
- 6b. System creates real-time dashboard with drill-down capabilities
- 6c. User explores data interactively

#### Exception Flows

**E1: Insufficient Data**
- 3a. Not enough data available for requested time period
- 3b. System adjusts time period or warns user
- 3c. Continue with available data

**E2: Report Generation Timeout**
- 4a. Report generation takes longer than timeout limit
- 4b. System offers to generate simplified report
- 4c. User chooses simplified version or extends timeout

#### Business Rules
- **BR-001**: Reports generated within 5 minutes for standard templates
- **BR-002**: Historical data retained for 2 years
- **BR-003**: Reports automatically include data quality metrics

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Reports include executive summary with key insights
- Visualizations are publication-ready
- Reports support multiple output formats (PDF, PowerPoint, HTML)

## Use Case Dependencies

### High-Priority Dependencies
- UC-001 depends on UC-002 (need trained models for detection)
- UC-004 depends on UC-001 (streaming uses same detection logic)
- UC-003 depends on UC-002 (need multiple trained models for comparison)

### Medium-Priority Dependencies  
- UC-005 depends on UC-002 and UC-003 (ensemble needs multiple models)
- UC-006 depends on UC-001 (monitoring needs deployed models)
- UC-007 depends on UC-002 (versioning needs multiple model versions)
- UC-008 depends on UC-004 (drift detection for streaming)

### Low-Priority Dependencies
- UC-009 depends on UC-001 (explanation needs predictions)
- UC-010 depends on UC-002 (threshold optimization needs trained models)
- UC-011 depends on UC-001 and UC-004 (integration needs detection capabilities)
- UC-012 depends on UC-001 (reporting needs detection results)
