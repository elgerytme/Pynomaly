**What to Include:**
- Description of the incident and context
- Relevant timestamps and communication records
- Impact on the community or technical systems
- Any immediate safety or security concerns
- Suggested remediation steps if applicable

### Response Process

Community leaders will follow these steps when addressing violations:

1. **Acknowledgment**: Confirm receipt of report within 24 hours
2. **Investigation**: Review the incident and gather necessary information

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior or compromising MLOps infrastructure security.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals, or severe compromise of MLOps systems.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

### Special Considerations for MLOps

**Model Security Violations:**

- Potential legal action for severe security breaches

**Data Privacy Violations:**
- Immediate investigation and remediation of any data exposure
- Review of access permissions and audit logs
- Compliance reporting as required by applicable regulations

**Infrastructure Tampering:**
