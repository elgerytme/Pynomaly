# Neuro-Symbolic AI

Advanced neuro-symbolic AI package that combines neural networks with symbolic reasoning for enhanced pattern recognition and interpretable AI systems.

## Features

- **Hybrid Neural-Symbolic Models**: Integration of deep learning with symbolic reasoning
- **Knowledge Graph Integration**: Semantic reasoning over structured knowledge
- **Interpretable AI**: Explainable decision-making processes
- **Logic-Enhanced Learning**: Symbolic constraints in neural training
- **Multi-Modal Reasoning**: Text, image, and structured data processing

## Quick Start

```python
from neuro_symbolic import NeuroSymbolicModel
from neuro_symbolic.domain.entities import KnowledgeGraph

# Create a neuro-symbolic model
model = NeuroSymbolicModel(
    neural_backbone="transformer",
    symbolic_reasoner="first_order_logic"
)

# Load knowledge base
kg = KnowledgeGraph.from_file("knowledge_base.owl")
model.add_knowledge_graph(kg)

# Train with symbolic constraints
model.train(data, symbolic_constraints=constraints)

# Make interpretable predictions
result = model.predict_with_explanation(input_data)
```

## Architecture

### Domain Layer
- **Entities**: Core neuro-symbolic concepts (models, knowledge graphs, rules)
- **Value Objects**: Reasoning results, explanation traces
- **Services**: Symbolic reasoning, neural-symbolic fusion

### Application Layer
- **Use Cases**: Model training, inference, explanation generation
- **Services**: High-level orchestration of neuro-symbolic workflows

### Infrastructure Layer
- **Adapters**: Neural network frameworks, symbolic reasoners
- **Repositories**: Model persistence, knowledge base storage

### Presentation Layer
- **CLI**: Command-line tools for training and inference
- **API**: REST endpoints for neuro-symbolic services
- **Web**: Interactive reasoning interfaces
