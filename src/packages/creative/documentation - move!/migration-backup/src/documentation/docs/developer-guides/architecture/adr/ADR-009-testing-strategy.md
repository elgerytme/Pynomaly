# ADR-009: Testing Strategy

🍞 **Breadcrumb:** 🏠 [Home](../../../index.md) > 👨‍💻 [Developer Guides](../../README.md) > 🏗️ [Architecture](../README.md) > 📋 [ADR](README.md) > Testing Strategy

## Status

PLANNED

## Context

### Problem Statement
Pynomaly requires a comprehensive testing strategy that ensures code quality, system reliability, and rapid development feedback while maintaining high test coverage across all components.

### Goals
- Achieve comprehensive test coverage across all system components
- Implement automated testing pipelines
- Enable rapid feedback for development teams
- Ensure quality gates for production deployments

### Constraints
- Must support multiple testing levels (unit, integration, e2e)
- Should minimize test execution time
- Must integrate with CI/CD pipeline
- Should support various testing frameworks

### Assumptions
- Test automation will be crucial for development velocity
- Code coverage requirements will increase over time
- Testing infrastructure will need to scale with system growth
- Quality standards will become more stringent
