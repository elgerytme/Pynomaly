# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

🍞 **Breadcrumb:** 🏠 [Home](../../../index.md) > 👨‍💻 [Developer Guides](../../README.md) > 🏗️ [Architecture](../README.md) > 📋 ADR Index

This directory contains all Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for the Pynomaly project. ADRs document the significant architectural decisions made during the development of the system, including the context, options considered, and consequences of each decision.

## 📚 ADR Templates & Standards

### **Creating New ADRs**

Use the standardized [ADR Template](adr-template.md) for all new architectural decisions. Each ADR should follow the established format and include:

- **Context**: Problem statement, goals, constraints, and assumptions
- **Decision**: Chosen solution and rationale
- **Architecture**: System diagrams and component interactions
- **Options**: Alternative solutions considered and why they were rejected
- **Implementation**: Technical approach, migration strategy, and testing
- **Consequences**: Positive, negative, and neutral impacts
- **Compliance**: Security, performance, and monitoring considerations

### **ADR Lifecycle**

ADRs progress through the following states:

- **PROPOSED** - Initial proposal under review
- **ACCEPTED** - Approved and being implemented
- **IMPLEMENTED** - Fully implemented and operational
- **DEPRECATED** - No longer recommended for new development
- **SUPERSEDED** - Replaced by a newer ADR

### **Cross-References**

ADRs are interconnected and reference each other where decisions are related:

- **Dependencies**: ADRs that must be implemented first
- **Influences**: ADRs that impact or are impacted by this decision
- **Conflicts**: ADRs that may have contradictory recommendations
