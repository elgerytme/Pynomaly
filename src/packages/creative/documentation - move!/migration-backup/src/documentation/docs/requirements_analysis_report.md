## Immediate Priorities

1. **Dependency Resolution**: Simplify installation of optional features
2. **CLI Conversion**: Convert remaining modules from Click to Typer
3. **Web UI Fixes**: Resolve circular imports and mounting issues
4. **Documentation Validation**: Test all code examples
5. **Testing Infrastructure**: Improve coverage for experimental features

## Recommendations

### 1. Missing Requirements Document
- **Action**: Create `docs/project/REQUIREMENTS.md` to document core functional and non-functional requirements
- **Priority**: High
- **Impact**: Essential for project governance and stakeholder alignment

### 2. Feature Implementation Gaps
- **Action**: Address the 80-95% gap between documented features and actual implementation
- **Priority**: High
- **Impact**: Reduces user confusion and improves adoption

### 3. Documentation Alignment
- **Action**: Ensure all documentation reflects actual implementation status
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Impact**: Improves developer experience and reduces support burden

### 4. Testing Coverage
- **Action**: Increase test coverage for experimental features
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Impact**: Reduces technical debt and improves reliability

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Documentation-Implementation Gap**: 80-95% of documented features not fully implemented
- **Optional Dependencies**: Complex installation process for advanced features
- **Missing Core Requirements**: No formal requirements documentation

### Medium Risk
- **Experimental Features**: Limited support for AutoML, Deep Learning
- **Authentication**: JWT framework present but needs configuration
- **Circular Imports**: Web UI stability issues

### Low Risk
- **Core Features**: 40+ PyOD algorithms working reliably
- **Architecture**: Clean architecture properly implemented
- **Testing**: 85%+ coverage with comprehensive framework

## Next Steps

1. **Create Requirements Document**: Establish formal requirements documentation
2. **Feature Gap Analysis**: Detailed mapping of documentation vs. implementation
3. **Dependency Simplification**: Streamline installation process
4. **Testing Enhancement**: Improve coverage for experimental features
5. **Documentation Validation**: Ensure all examples work with current implementation
