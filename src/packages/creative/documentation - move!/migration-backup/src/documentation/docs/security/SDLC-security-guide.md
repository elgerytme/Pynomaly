## Overview

This guide provides best practices and strategies for incorporating security into every phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It emphasizes the importance of integrating security activities and objectives at each stage to ensure the delivery of robust and secure software.

## SDLC Phases

1. **Planning**
   - Establish security requirements.
   - Define security objectives and key performance indicators (KPIs).
   - Conduct risk assessment and threat modeling.

2. **Design**
   - Apply secure design principles.
   - Perform architectural risk analysis.
   - Define security controls and standards.

3. **Implementation**
   - Use secure coding practices.
   - Conduct static and dynamic code analysis.
   - Perform peer code reviews with a focus on security.

4. **Testing**
   - Conduct security testing alongside functional testing.
   - Use automated tools for vulnerability scanning.
   - Perform penetration testing and ethical hacking.

5. **Deployment**
   - Implement security in infrastructure as code.
   - Configure secure environments and access controls.
   - Ensure secure deployment with continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD).

6. **Maintenance**
   - Consistently monitor and log security events.
   - Regularly update and patch systems.
   - Perform ongoing security assessments and audits.
