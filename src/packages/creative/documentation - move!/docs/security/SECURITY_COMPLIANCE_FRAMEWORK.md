# Security & Compliance Framework

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security and compliance framework for the Pynomaly project, covering security auditing, compliance standards, data protection, and access control systems.

## Security Standards & Compliance

### 1. Security Audit Implementation âœ…

#### Automated Security Scanning
- **Bandit**: Python security linter for code vulnerability detection
- **Safety**: Dependency vulnerability scanner for third-party packages
- **Semgrep**: Advanced code security analysis with custom rules
- **Trivy**: Container and filesystem vulnerability scanning

#### Security Scanning Results
All security scans are automated in the CI/CD pipeline and generate:
- JSON reports for programmatic processing
- Text summaries for human review
- SARIF format for GitHub security tab integration

### 2. Compliance Frameworks âœ…

#### Current Compliance Standards
- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**: Data privacy and protection
- **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)**: Consumer data rights
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Security, availability, and confidentiality controls
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management system

#### Compliance Documentation
- Data processing agreements
- Privacy impact assessments
- Security control documentation
- Incident response procedures

### 3. Data Protection Measures âœ…

#### Encryption Implementation
- **Data at Rest**: AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive database fields
- **Data in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all API communications
- **Key Management**: PBKDF2 and Scrypt for key derivation
- **Field-Level Encryption**: Automatic PII field encryption

#### Data Classification
- **Public**: Documentation, non-sensitive configuration
- **Internal**: Business logic, non-PII user data
- **Confidential**: User credentials, API keys, tokens
- **Restricted**: PII, financial data, health information

### 4. Access Control Systems âœ…

#### Authentication Framework
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: TOTP, SMS, and email verification
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: RSA-based tokens with key rotation
- **Session Management**: Concurrent session limits and timeout controls
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing with complexity requirements

#### Authorization Framework
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Hierarchical permission system
- **Permission Matrix**: Granular resource access controls
- **API Key Management**: Prefix-based keys with scope limitations
- **Account Lockout**: Automatic lockout after failed attempts

#### User Role Hierarchy
1. **Super Admin**: Full system access and user management
2. **Tenant Admin**: Tenant-specific administrative privileges
3. **Data Scientist**: Advanced ML model and data access
4. **Analyst**: Data analysis and reporting capabilities
5. **Viewer**: Read-only access to dashboards and reports

### 5. Audit Logging System âœ…

#### Comprehensive Audit Events
- **Authentication Events**: Login attempts, MFA challenges, session management
- **Authorization Events**: Permission checks, role changes, access denials
- **Data Events**: Data access, modification, and deletion
- **System Events**: Configuration changes, system errors, security alerts

#### Audit Log Features
- **Risk Scoring**: Automated risk assessment for audit events
- **Correlation IDs**: Request tracing across system components
- **Immutable Logs**: Cryptographic integrity verification
- **Retention Policy**: Configurable log retention periods

### 6. Security Monitoring & Threat Detection âœ…

#### Real-Time Monitoring
- **Behavioral Analysis**: ML-based anomaly detection for user behavior
- **Threat Intelligence**: Integration with external threat feeds
- **Security Metrics**: Real-time security dashboard and alerts
- **Incident Response**: Automated response workflows

#### Security Controls
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Protection against common attacks
- **Security Headers**: CSP, HSTS, and anti-clickjacking protection
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive sanitization and validation
- **Rate Limiting**: API and authentication rate limiting

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth Strategy
1. **Network Security**: Firewall rules and network segmentation
2. **Application Security**: Input validation and output encoding
3. **Data Security**: Encryption and access controls
4. **Identity Security**: Strong authentication and authorization
5. **Operational Security**: Monitoring and incident response

### Zero Trust Principles
- **Never Trust, Always Verify**: Continuous authentication and authorization
- **Least Privilege Access**: Minimal required permissions
- **Micro-Segmentation**: Granular network and application controls
- **Assume Breach**: Continuous monitoring and response capabilities

## Compliance Verification

### Security Audit Checklist
- [ ] All security scans passing (Bandit, Safety, Semgrep)
- [ ] Vulnerability assessments completed
- [ ] Penetration testing performed
- [ ] Security configuration validated
- [ ] Access controls verified
- [ ] Audit logs functioning correctly
- [ ] Incident response procedures tested
- [ ] Data encryption validated

### Compliance Verification Steps
1. **Automated Scanning**: Continuous security scanning in CI/CD
2. **Manual Review**: Regular security code reviews
3. **Penetration Testing**: Quarterly external security assessments
4. **Compliance Audits**: Annual third-party compliance verification
5. **Documentation Updates**: Continuous compliance documentation maintenance
