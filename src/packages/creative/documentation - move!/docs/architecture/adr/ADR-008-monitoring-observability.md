🍞 **Breadcrumb:** 🏠 [Home](../../../index.md) > 👨‍💻 [Developer Guides](../../README.md) > 🏗️ [Architecture](../README.md) > 📋 [ADR](README.md) > Monitoring and Observability

## Status

PLANNED

## Context

### Problem Statement
Pynomaly requires comprehensive monitoring and observability capabilities to ensure system health, performance tracking, and rapid incident response in production environments.

### Goals
- Implement comprehensive system monitoring and alerting
- Provide detailed performance and health metrics
- Enable rapid incident detection and response
- Support distributed tracing and debugging capabilities

### Constraints
- Must scale with system growth
- Should minimize performance impact
- Must integrate with existing infrastructure
- Should support multiple deployment environments

### Assumptions
- System complexity will continue to increase
- Performance monitoring will be critical for operations
- Incident response time will be crucial for user experience
- Observability data will need long-term retention
