# CI/CD Workflow Simplification Guide

## Overview

This guide documents the simplification of Pynomaly's CI/CD workflows from **33 separate workflow files** to **3 unified workflows**, dramatically reducing complexity while maintaining comprehensive functionality.

## Problem Statement

The original CI/CD setup had become unwieldy with:
- **33 separate workflow files** with overlapping responsibilities
- **Duplicated configurations** across multiple files
- **Complex dependencies** between workflows
- **Maintenance overhead** for updating similar configurations
- **Poor visibility** into overall pipeline status
- **Resource waste** from redundant job executions

## Solution: Unified Workflows

### 1. CI Unified Pipeline (`ci-unified.yml`)

**Purpose:** Comprehensive continuous integration with all quality checks

**Responsibilities:**
- Code quality validation (linting, formatting, type checking)
- Security scanning (Bandit, Safety, vulnerability detection)
- Documentation validation (MkDocs, link checking)
- Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, security, API)
- Build and package creation
- Docker image building and security scanning
- Unified reporting and status updates

**Key Features:**
- Matrix testing across Python versions and test types
- Parallel execution with optimized caching
- Comprehensive artifact collection
- Automatic PR status reporting
- Unified CI summary dashboard

### 2. CD Unified Pipeline (`cd-unified.yml`)

**Purpose:** Streamlined continuous deployment to all environments

**Responsibilities:**
- Automated environment detection (staging/production)
- Docker image building and pushing to registry
- Security scanning of production images
- Environment-specific deployment logic
- Automated health checks and smoke tests
- Backup creation for production deployments
- Deployment status tracking and notifications

**Key Features:**
- Smart environment routing
- Automated backup strategies
- Comprehensive health validation
- Deployment artifact management
- Slack/notification integration

### 3. Maintenance Unified Pipeline (`maintenance-unified.yml`)

**Purpose:** Automated maintenance tasks and system health monitoring

**Responsibilities:**
- Security auditing and vulnerability scanning
- Dependency analysis and update recommendations
- Code cleanup and technical debt monitoring
- Monitoring configuration validation
- Automated maintenance reporting
- Issue creation for critical findings

**Key Features:**
- Scheduled maintenance (daily, weekly, monthly)
- On-demand maintenance execution
- Comprehensive security auditing
- Automated cleanup operations
- Maintenance status dashboards

## Migration Benefits

### Complexity Reduction
- **Before:** 33 workflow files
- **After:** 3 unified workflows
- **Reduction:** 90% decrease in file count

### Maintenance Improvements
- **Single source of truth** for CI/CD logic
- **Unified configuration** reduces duplication
- **Consistent patterns** across all workflows
- **Easier updates** and modifications

### Performance Optimizations
- **Parallel execution** where possible
- **Optimized caching** strategies
- **Reduced resource usage** through consolidation
- **Faster feedback** loops

### Better Visibility
- **Unified reporting** and dashboards
- **Clear status indicators** for all pipeline stages
- **Comprehensive artifact collection**
- **Automated notifications** and alerts

## Workflow Consolidation Mapping

| Original Workflows | New Unified Workflow | Notes |
|-------------------|---------------------|--------|
| ci.yml, test.yml, build.yml, quality-gates.yml | ci-unified.yml | All CI tasks consolidated |
| cd.yml, deploy.yml, production-deployment.yml | cd-unified.yml | Deployment pipeline unified |
| security.yml, dependency-update-bot.yml | ci-unified.yml + maintenance-unified.yml | Split between CI and maintenance |
| maintenance.yml, cleanup.yml, monitoring.yml | maintenance-unified.yml | All maintenance tasks unified |
| All testing workflows | ci-unified.yml | Comprehensive testing matrix |
| All validation workflows | ci-unified.yml | Validation in unified CI |

## Implementation Details

### Caching Strategy
```yaml
- name: Cache dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: |
      ~/.cache/pip
      ~/.cache/hatch
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-python-${{ env.PYTHON_VERSION }}-${{ hashFiles('**/pyproject.toml') }}
```

### Matrix Testing
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    python-version: ["3.11", "3.12"]
    test-suite: ["unit", "integration", "security", "api"]
  fail-fast: false
```

### Environment Detection
```yaml
- name: Determine deployment environment
  run: |
    if [[ "${{ github.ref }}" == "refs/heads/main" ]]; then
      ENVIRONMENT="production"
    else
      ENVIRONMENT="staging"
    fi
```

## Usage Guide

### Running CI Pipeline
```bash
# Triggered automatically on push/PR
git push origin feature-branch

# Manual trigger
gh workflow run ci-unified.yml
```

### Running CD Pipeline
```bash
# Automatic deployment to staging
git push origin develop

# Automatic deployment to production
git push origin main

# Manual deployment
gh workflow run cd-unified.yml -f environment=production
```

### Running Maintenance
```bash
# Run all maintenance tasks
gh workflow run maintenance-unified.yml -f maintenance_type=all

# Run specific maintenance
gh workflow run maintenance-unified.yml -f maintenance_type=security
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```yaml
env:
  PYTHON_VERSION: "3.11"
  HATCH_VERSION: "1.12.0"
  REGISTRY: ghcr.io
  IMAGE_NAME: ${{ github.repository }}
```

### Required Secrets
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` (automatic)
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` (for notifications)
- Environment-specific secrets for deployments

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Artifacts Generated
- **CI Reports:** Test results, coverage reports, security scans
- **CD Reports:** Deployment summaries, health check results
- **Maintenance Reports:** Security audits, dependency analysis, cleanup reports

### Status Indicators
- **PR Comments:** Automated status updates on pull requests
- **Slack Notifications:** Real-time deployment and maintenance alerts
- **GitHub Status:** Clear pass/fail indicators for all pipeline stages

## Rollback and Recovery

### Workflow Rollback
```bash
# Restore from backup
cp backups/workflows/[timestamp]/*.yml .github/workflows/

# Selective restoration
cp backups/workflows/[timestamp]/ci.yml .github/workflows/
```

### Emergency Procedures
1. **Disable workflows** via GitHub settings if needed
2. **Manual deployment** using Docker scripts
3. **Hotfix deployment** bypassing normal CI/CD

## Best Practices

### Workflow Development
1. **Test locally** before committing workflow changes
2. **Use workflow dispatch** for manual testing
3. **Monitor resource usage** and optimize as needed
4. **Keep workflows focused** on their core responsibilities

### Maintenance
1. **Regular review** of workflow performance
2. **Update dependencies** in workflows
3. **Monitor for security vulnerabilities**
4. **Clean up old artifacts** periodically

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
- **Advanced caching** strategies
- **Workflow templates** for reusability
- **Enhanced monitoring** and alerting
- **Integration testing** improvements

### Extensibility
- **Plugin system** for custom checks
- **Environment-specific** configurations
- **Advanced deployment** strategies
- **Multi-cloud** support

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Workflow failures:** Check individual job logs
2. **Caching issues:** Clear cache and retry
3. **Permission errors:** Verify GitHub token permissions
4. **Deployment failures:** Check environment configurations
