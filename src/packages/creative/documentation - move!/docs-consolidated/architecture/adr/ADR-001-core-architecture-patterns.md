# ADR-001: Core Architecture Patterns

🍞 **Breadcrumb:** 🏠 [Home](../../../index.md) > 👨‍💻 [Developer Guides](../../README.md) > 🏗️ [Architecture](../README.md) > 📋 [ADR](README.md) > Core Architecture Patterns

## Status

PLANNED

## Context

### Problem Statement
Pynomaly needs a consistent architectural foundation that guides development decisions and ensures maintainable, scalable, and testable code across all components.

### Goals
- Establish clear architectural patterns for all system components
- Ensure consistent implementation across the codebase
- Provide guidelines for new feature development
- Support clean architecture principles

### Constraints
- Must align with existing codebase structure
- Should support both monolithic and microservices architectures
- Must facilitate testing and maintainability
- Should enable future scalability

### Assumptions
- Development team will follow established patterns
- Patterns will evolve with system requirements
- Clear documentation will reduce implementation inconsistencies
