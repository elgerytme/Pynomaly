## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive container security implementation for Pynomaly, covering hardened Docker images, vulnerability scanning, security best practices, and continuous integration workflows.

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Features

#### 1. Hardened Docker Images
- **Multi-stage builds** with separate build and runtime stages
- **Non-root execution** with dedicated `pynomaly` user (UID 1000)
- **Minimal attack surface** with only required runtime dependencies
- **Security hardening** with no-new-privileges and dropped capabilities
- **Resource limits** and health checks for production deployment

#### 2. Container Security Scanning
- **Trivy integration** for vulnerability scanning
- **Secrets detection** in container images
- **Misconfiguration analysis** for security issues
- **SARIF output** for GitHub Security integration
- **Automated reporting** with security scoring

#### 3. CI/CD Integration
- **GitHub Actions workflow** for automated security scanning
- **Security gate** implementation in build pipeline
- **SARIF upload** to GitHub Security tab
- **Artifact collection** for security reports

#### 4. Build System Integration
- **Makefile targets** for container security operations
- **Docker build** with security-focused configurations
- **Automated scanning** with comprehensive reporting

## Security Features

### Container Image Hardening
- Uses Ubuntu 22.04 with minimal runtime dependencies
- Runs as non-root user (pynomaly:1000)
- Drops all capabilities except NET_BIND_SERVICE
- Implements proper signal handling with tini
- Includes comprehensive health checks

### Security Scanning
- Vulnerability detection for all severity levels
- Secret scanning to prevent credential exposure
- Container misconfiguration detection
- Dockerfile security best practices validation

### Reporting and Monitoring
- JSON format reports for programmatic analysis
- Security scoring system (0-100 scale)
- Risk level classification (low, medium, high, critical)
- GitHub Security tab integration via SARIF

## Usage

### Building Hardened Images
```bash
make docker-build-hardened
```

### Running Security Scans
```bash
make docker-security-scan
```

### Complete Security Pipeline
```bash
make docker-security-all
```

### Custom Scanning
```bash
python scripts/security/run_container_scans.py pynomaly:hardened --output-dir reports/security --fail-on-critical
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Image Hardening
- Use minimal base images
- Run as non-root user
- Remove unnecessary packages
- Implement proper signal handling
- Use multi-stage builds

### 2. Runtime Security
- Drop unnecessary capabilities
- Use security profiles
- Implement resource limits
- Enable read-only root filesystem
- Use proper network segmentation

### 3. Vulnerability Management
- Regular security scanning
- Automated vulnerability detection
- Rapid response to critical issues
- Security patch management
- Dependency monitoring

### 4. Secrets Management
- No secrets in container images
- Use external secret management
- Implement secret rotation
- Secure secret injection
- Audit secret access

## Security Metrics

### Vulnerability Tracking
- Total vulnerabilities by severity
- Critical/High vulnerability counts
- Security score (0-100)
- Risk level assessment
- Remediation tracking

### Compliance Monitoring
- Security scan frequency
- Policy compliance status
- Audit trail maintenance
- Incident response metrics
- Recovery time tracking

## Integration Points

### GitHub Security
- SARIF format vulnerability reports
- Security tab integration
- Automated security alerts
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code quality analysis

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Build-time security scanning
- Security gate implementation
- Automated report generation
- Artifact collection
- Deployment blocking on critical issues

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Trivy not found**: Install Trivy using package manager
2. **Docker not available**: Ensure Docker is installed and running
3. **Permission denied**: Check Docker daemon permissions
4. **Scan failures**: Verify image exists and is accessible

### Debugging
- Enable verbose logging with `--verbose` flag
- Check security reports in `reports/security/`
- Review GitHub Actions logs for CI/CD issues
- Verify Trivy and Docker installations
