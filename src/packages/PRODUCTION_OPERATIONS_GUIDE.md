# Production Operations Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for operating the hexagonal architecture system in production environments. It covers deployment automation, monitoring, disaster recovery, and operational procedures.

## üöÄ Deployment Operations

### Automated Deployment Script

The automated deployment script provides intelligent deployment capabilities with multiple strategies:

```bash
# Basic production deployment
./src/packages/deployment/scripts/automated-deployment.sh -e production -s rolling

# Blue-green deployment with extended monitoring
./src/packages/deployment/scripts/automated-deployment.sh -e production -s blue-green -m 600

# Canary deployment with auto-approval
./src/packages/deployment/scripts/automated-deployment.sh -e production -s canary --auto-approve

# Dry run to preview changes
./src/packages/deployment/scripts/automated-deployment.sh -e production --dry-run
```

### Deployment Strategies

#### Rolling Deployment (Default)
- Zero-downtime updates
- Gradual pod replacement
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Best for: Regular updates, low-risk changes

#### Blue-Green Deployment
- Complete environment switch
- Instant rollback capability
- Full validation before traffic switch
- Best for: Major releases, database migrations

#### Canary Deployment
- Gradual traffic increase (10% ‚Üí 100%)
- Real-time metrics validation
- Automated rollback on anomalies
- Best for: High-risk changes, new features

### Pre-deployment Checklist
