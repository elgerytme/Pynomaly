from interfaces.events import AnomalyDetected
from shared import get_container, publish_event

# Implement service
class MyDetectionService(Service):
    async def execute(self, request: DetectionRequest) -> DetectionResult:
        # Business logic
        result = await self.detect_anomalies(request)
        
        # Publish events
        await publish_event(AnomalyDetected(
            dataset_id=request.dataset_id,
            anomaly_count=result.anomalies_count
        ))
        
        return result

# Register and use
container = get_container()
container.register_singleton(MyDetectionService)
service = container.resolve(MyDetectionService)
```

```python
# CQRS Commands and Queries
command_response = await command_bus.send(ProcessDataQualityCommand(
    dataset_id="dataset_123",
    quality_rules=["completeness", "validity"]
))

query_response = await query_bus.ask(GetDataQualityReportQuery(
    dataset_id="dataset_123",
    include_details=True
))

# Event Sourcing
workflow = DataProcessingWorkflowAggregate("workflow_001")
workflow.start_processing("dataset_123", "full_pipeline")
await repository.save(workflow)  # Stores events

# Saga Orchestration
saga_state = await saga_orchestrator.start_saga("pipeline_saga", [
