# Infrastructure Package

The infrastructure package provides technical cross-cutting concerns and foundational services for the entire monorepo. It implements the infrastructure layer of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture, handling technical aspects like persistence, messaging, caching, security, and monitoring.

## Purpose

This package serves as the technical foundation that enables domain packages to focus on business logic by abstracting away infrastructure concerns. It provides:

- **Persistence Layer**: Database connections, repositories, and data access patterns
- **Messaging & Communication**: Message queues, event buses, and inter-service communication
- **Caching**: Distributed caching solutions and cache management
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, encryption, and security utilities
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Logging, metrics, tracing, and health checks
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific settings and configuration loading
- **External Integrations**: Third-party service adapters and API clients

## Architecture

The infrastructure package follows Clean Architecture principles:

```
infrastructure/
├── adapters/          # External service adapters
├── persistence/       # Database and storage implementations
├── messaging/         # Message queues and event handling
├── security/          # Authentication and authorization
├── monitoring/        # Observability and health checks
├── caching/          # Caching strategies and implementations  
├── configuration/    # Configuration management
└── integrations/     # Third-party service integrations
```

## Key Components

### Persistence Layer
- Database connection management
- Repository pattern implementations
- Transaction management
- Data migration utilities

### Messaging Infrastructure
- Event bus implementations
- Message queue integrations (Redis, RabbitMQ, Kafka)
- Async message handling
- Event sourcing support

### Security Infrastructure
- JWT token management
- OAuth2/OIDC implementations
- Encryption/decryption utilities
- Rate limiting and throttling

### Monitoring & Observability
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Metrics collection (Prometheus)
- Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
- Health check endpoints

### Caching
- Redis-based caching
- Cache-aside and write-through patterns
- Cache invalidation strategies
- Distributed cache coordination

## Usage

```python
from infrastructure.persistence import DatabaseConnection
from infrastructure.messaging import EventBus
from infrastructure.security import JWTManager
from infrastructure.monitoring import get_logger

# Database operations
db = DatabaseConnection()
repository = UserRepository(db)

# Event publishing
event_bus = EventBus()
event_bus.publish(UserCreatedEvent(user_id="123"))

# Security
jwt_manager = JWTManager()
token = jwt_manager.create_token(user_id="123")

# Logging
logger = get_logger(__name__)
logger.info("Operation completed", user_id="123")
```

## Dependencies

The infrastructure package includes optional dependency groups for different use cases:

- `dev`: Development tools and testing utilities
- `test`: Testing frameworks and test doubles  
- `docs`: Documentation generation tools
- `database`: Database-specific drivers and tools
- `cloud`: Cloud provider integrations
- `messaging`: Message broker integrations
- `monitoring`: Observability and monitoring tools
- `security`: Security scanning and validation tools

Install with specific dependencies:

```bash
pip install infrastructure[database,messaging,monitoring]
```

## Configuration

Infrastructure components are configured through environment variables and configuration files:

```python
from infrastructure.configuration import InfrastructureConfig

config = InfrastructureConfig()
```

## Design Principles

1. **Dependency Inversion**: Infrastructure depends on abstractions, not concretions
2. **Plugin Architecture**: Components are pluggable and replaceable
3. **Configuration-Driven**: Behavior controlled through configuration, not code changes
4. **Observability First**: Built-in logging, metrics, and tracing
5. **Security by Default**: Secure defaults and security-first design
6. **Performance Optimized**: Async-first with connection pooling and caching

## Integration Guidelines

- Domain packages should depend on infrastructure abstractions, not implementations
- Use dependency injection to provide infrastructure services to domain layers
- Infrastructure implementations should be swappable without affecting domain logic
- Follow the Repository pattern for data access
- Use event-driven architecture for cross-domain communication

## Testing

The infrastructure package includes comprehensive testing utilities:

```python
from infrastructure.testing import TestDatabase, MockEventBus

# Integration tests with real infrastructure
def test_with_database():
    with TestDatabase() as db:
        repository = UserRepository(db)
        # Test with real database

# Unit tests with mocks
def test_with_mocks():
    event_bus = MockEventBus()
    service = UserService(event_bus)
    # Test with mocked infrastructure
```

## Performance Considerations

- Connection pooling for database and external services
- Async/await patterns for I/O operations
- Caching strategies to reduce external calls
- Batch operations for bulk data processing
- Circuit breakers for external service resilience

## Security Features

- Secrets management and rotation
- Encrypted configuration storage
- Audit logging for security events
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Secure communication protocols (TLS/SSL)

## Monitoring and Alerting

- Application performance monitoring (APM)
- Infrastructure health checks
- Custom metrics and alerts
- Distributed tracing across services
- Error tracking and aggregation

## Maintenance and Operations

- Automated database migrations
- Configuration drift detection
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Performance profiling and optimization
- Capacity planning and scaling guidance
