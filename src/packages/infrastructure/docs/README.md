## Quick Start

1. **Installation**: Install the infrastructure package with required dependencies
2. **Configuration**: Set up environment variables and configuration files
3. **Integration**: Integrate infrastructure services with your domain packages
4. **Monitoring**: Configure logging, metrics, and health checks
5. **Deployment**: Deploy using containerization or cloud services

## Key Concepts

### Dependency Inversion
Infrastructure components depend on abstractions, allowing for easy testing and swapping of implementations.

### Plugin Architecture
Components are designed as plugins that can be enabled, disabled, or replaced without affecting core functionality.

### Observability First
Built-in logging, metrics, and tracing provide comprehensive visibility into system behavior.

### Security by Default
Security features are enabled by default with secure configurations and best practices.

### Performance Optimized
Async-first design with connection pooling, caching, and performance monitoring.
