## What is Anomaly Detection?

### Simple Definition
**Anomaly detection** is like having a highly trained security guard who knows what "normal" looks like and can instantly spot when something is "unusual" or "suspicious." In banking, this technology automatically monitors millions of transactions, user behaviors, and system activities to identify patterns that deviate from the norm.

### Key Concepts

**Normal Behavior**: What typically happens in your bank's operations
- Regular customer transaction patterns
- Standard employee access behaviors  
- Typical system performance metrics
- Expected market movements

**Anomalies/Outliers**: Deviations from normal patterns
- Unusual transaction amounts or frequencies
- Access attempts from unexpected locations
- System performance spikes or drops
- Suspicious account activities

### Types of Anomalies in Banking

1. **Point Anomalies**: Single unusual events
   - A $50,000 withdrawal from an account that typically sees $500 transactions
   - Login from a country where the customer has never traveled

2. **Contextual Anomalies**: Normal actions in wrong context
   - Large transfers during holiday weekends
   - ATM withdrawals at 3 AM in rural locations

3. **Collective Anomalies**: Groups of related unusual events
   - Multiple small transactions adding up to large sums
   - Coordinated attacks across multiple accounts

## Why Banks Need Anomaly Detection

### The Business Challenge

Modern banks process **millions of transactions daily** across multiple channels:
- Online banking
- Mobile applications
- ATM networks
- Credit card systems
- Wire transfers
- Investment platforms

**Traditional rule-based systems** struggle with:
- **Volume**: Cannot process millions of transactions in real-time
- **Sophistication**: Fraudsters adapt faster than rule updates
- **False Positives**: Too many legitimate transactions flagged
- **Manual Overhead**: Requires extensive human review

### Regulatory Requirements

Banks must comply with numerous regulations requiring anomaly detection:
- **Anti-Money Laundering (AML)**: Detect suspicious transaction patterns
- **Know Your Customer (KYC)**: Monitor customer behavior changes
- **Fraud Prevention**: Implement robust detection systems
- **Operational Risk Management**: Monitor system and process anomalies

### Financial Impact

**Cost of Fraud**: Global banking fraud losses exceed $30 billion annually
**Compliance Penalties**: AML violations can result in fines exceeding $1 billion
**Operational Costs**: Manual review processes are expensive and slow
**Reputation Risk**: Security breaches damage customer trust and brand value

---

## How Anomaly Detection Works

### The Learning Process

Think of anomaly detection like training a new employee to spot suspicious activity:

1. **Training Phase**: Show the system thousands of examples of normal transactions
2. **Pattern Recognition**: The system learns what "normal" looks like across different scenarios
3. **Detection Phase**: When new transactions occur, the system compares them to learned patterns
4. **Scoring**: Each transaction receives a risk score based on how unusual it appears
5. **Action**: High-risk transactions are flagged for review or blocked

### Machine Learning Approaches

**Supervised Learning**:
- Uses labeled examples of both normal and fraudulent transactions
- Like showing a new employee examples of known fraud cases
- Highly accurate but requires extensive historical fraud data

**Unsupervised Learning**:
- Learns patterns from normal transactions only
- Identifies deviations without needing fraud examples
- Can detect new, previously unknown types of fraud

**Semi-Supervised Learning**:
- Combines both approaches
- Uses mostly normal data with some fraud examples
- Balances accuracy with ability to find new fraud types

### Real-Time vs. Batch Processing

**Real-Time Detection**:
- Analyzes transactions as they occur
- Enables immediate blocking or flagging
- Critical for payment processing and ATM transactions

**Batch Processing**:
- Reviews transactions periodically (hourly, daily)
- Allows for more complex analysis
- Suitable for compliance reporting and trend analysis

## Ranking, Scoring & Prioritization

### The Challenge of Information Overload

Modern banks generate thousands of potential anomaly alerts daily. Without proper ranking and prioritization, analysts would be overwhelmed, leading to:
- **Alert Fatigue**: Important fraud cases missed due to volume
- **Resource Waste**: Time spent investigating low-risk anomalies
- **Delayed Response**: High-priority threats not addressed quickly
- **Inconsistent Review**: Different analysts applying different standards

### Risk Scoring Framework

**Anomaly Score (0-100)**
- **0-30**: Low risk - routine monitoring
- **31-60**: Medium risk - scheduled review
- **61-80**: High risk - priority investigation
- **81-100**: Critical risk - immediate action required

### Scoring Components

**1. Statistical Deviation Score**
- How far the transaction deviates from normal patterns
- Based on multiple algorithms' assessments
- Weighted by algorithm confidence levels

**2. Customer Risk Profile**
- Historical customer behavior patterns
- Account age and transaction history
- Geographic and demographic factors
- Previous fraud incidents or investigations

**3. Transaction Context Score**
- Time of transaction (unusual hours = higher risk)
- Location (new locations = higher risk)  
- Amount relative to typical transactions
- Payment method and channel used

**4. Network Analysis Score**
- Connections to other suspicious accounts
- Participation in potentially coordinated activities
- Links to known fraud networks or patterns

**5. External Intelligence Score**
- Integration with fraud databases
- Geopolitical risk indicators
- Merchant risk assessments
- Device and IP reputation data

### Prioritization Matrix

| Risk Level | Response Time | Analyst Level | Action Required |
|------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Critical (81-100) | Immediate | Senior Analyst | Block & Investigate |
| High (61-80) | 1 Hour | Experienced Analyst | Priority Review |
| Medium (31-60) | 4 Hours | Standard Analyst | Routine Investigation |
| Low (0-30) | 24 Hours | Automated/Junior | Monitor Only |
