## ❌ Not Implemented Features

### Graph Anomaly Detection (PyGOD)

**Status**: ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**Documentation Claims**: "PyGOD integration (experimental)"
**Reality**: No actual PyGOD implementation found
**Dependencies**: PyGOD mentioned but not integrated
**Recommendation**: Remove from feature lists until implemented

**Reality**:

- Basic Parquet support works
- Spark integration is placeholder
- HDF5 support requires manual setup

**Documentation Claims**: "Enterprise-grade security", "LDAP/SAML integration"
**Reality**:

- Basic JWT and rate limiting work
- LDAP/SAML not implemented
