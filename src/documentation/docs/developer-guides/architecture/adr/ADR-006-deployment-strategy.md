# ADR-006: Deployment Strategy

🍞 **Breadcrumb:** 🏠 [Home](../../../index.md) > 👨‍💻 [Developer Guides](../../README.md) > 🏗️ [Architecture](../README.md) > 📋 [ADR](README.md) > Deployment Strategy

## Status

PLANNED

## Context

### Problem Statement
Pynomaly requires a robust deployment strategy that supports various environments, ensures zero-downtime deployments, and enables rapid rollback capabilities.

### Goals
- Enable zero-downtime deployments
- Support multiple deployment environments (dev, staging, prod)
- Implement automated rollback mechanisms
- Ensure consistency across different deployment targets

### Constraints
- Must support both cloud and on-premise deployments
- Should minimize deployment complexity
- Must ensure data consistency during deployments
- Should support blue-green deployment patterns

### Assumptions
- Deployments will occur frequently
- Different environments will have varying requirements
- Rollback scenarios will be needed regularly
- Infrastructure as Code will be used
