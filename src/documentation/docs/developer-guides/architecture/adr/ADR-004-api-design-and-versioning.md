# ADR-004: API Design and Versioning

🍞 **Breadcrumb:** 🏠 [Home](../../../index.md) > 👨‍💻 [Developer Guides](../../README.md) > 🏗️ [Architecture](../README.md) > 📋 [ADR](README.md) > API Design and Versioning

## Status

PLANNED

## Context

### Problem Statement
The Pynomaly platform needs a consistent and scalable approach for API design and versioning to ensure backward compatibility and support evolving client needs.

### Goals
- Provide clear guidelines for API design standards
- Establish versioning strategies for backward compatibility
- Support multiple API versions concurrently
- Enable deprecation and evolution of APIs

### Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Should minimize disruption to existing clients
- Must comply with RESTful principles
- Should support rapid evolution of API features

### Assumptions
- Clients will need to access multiple API versions
- API changes will occur frequently as the system evolves
- Consistent design principles will enhance developer experience
