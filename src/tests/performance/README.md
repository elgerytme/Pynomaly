# Performance Monitoring Tests

This directory contains comprehensive unit and integration tests for the performance monitoring system, as required by Step 9 of the broader plan.

## Test Files

### `test_final_performance.py`
The main test file containing all required test categories:

#### 1. Unit Tests for Degradation Detector (Various Scenarios)
- **`test_degradation_detector_various_scenarios`**: Tests degradation detection with different z-score thresholds
- Scenarios tested:
  - Mean value (no degradation)
  - One standard deviation below mean (no degradation)
  - Two standard deviations below mean (at threshold)
  - Just below threshold (degradation detected)
  - Three and four standard deviations below mean (degradation detected)
  - Values above mean (no degradation)

#### 2. Repository Tests (In-Memory)
- **`test_repository_in_memory_operations`**: Tests basic CRUD operations
- Features tested:
  - Save entities with auto-generated IDs
  - Find by ID
  - Find all entities
  - Delete entities
  - Count entities
  - Proper entity lifecycle management

#### 3. Service Flow Test
- **`test_service_flow_metrics_degradation_alerts`**: Complete flow testing
- Features tested:
  - Record performance metrics
  - Set performance baselines
  - Automatic degradation detection
  - Alert generation when thresholds exceeded
  - Alert callbacks mechanism
  - Regression checking

#### 4. API Endpoint Tests
- **`test_api_endpoint_simulation`**: Tests API response structures
- Features tested:
  - GET requests to different endpoints
  - Proper JSON response formatting
  - HTTP status codes
  - Error handling (404 responses)

#### 5. Property-Based Tests with Hypothesis
- **`test_hypothesis_degradation_detection`**: Uses Hypothesis for property-based testing
- Features tested:
  - Degradation detection with random baseline values
  - Invariant properties (values close to baseline should not trigger degradation)
  - Edge cases with different baseline values

#### 6. Performance Metrics Aggregation
- **`test_performance_metrics_aggregation`**: Tests metrics collection and analysis
- Features tested:
  - Metrics recording with timestamps
  - Statistical calculations (mean, min, max, count)
  - Time-window filtering
  - Multi-operation support

## Key Features Tested

### Degradation Detection
- Z-score based degradation detection
- Configurable threshold factors
- Baseline comparison
- Statistical significance testing

### Repository Operations
- In-memory storage implementation
- CRUD operations with proper error handling
- Entity lifecycle management
- Data persistence simulation

### Service Integration
- End-to-end service flow
- Metrics → Degradation Detection → Alert Generation
- Callback mechanisms for real-time alerts
- Regression analysis

### API Simulation
- RESTful endpoint testing
- JSON response validation
- HTTP status code verification
- Error handling

## Technology Stack

- **pytest**: Primary testing framework
- **hypothesis**: Property-based testing for robust edge case coverage
- **datetime**: Time-based operations and window filtering
- **uuid**: Unique identifier generation
- **Python typing**: Type hints for better code quality

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all performance tests
python -m pytest tests/performance/ -v

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/performance/test_final_performance.py -v

# Run specific test method
python -m pytest tests/performance/test_final_performance.py::TestPerformanceMonitoring::test_degradation_detector_various_scenarios -v
```

## Test Coverage

The tests cover all requirements from Step 9:
- ✅ Unit tests for degradation detector (various scenarios)
- ✅ Repository tests (in-memory)
- ✅ Service flow test that records metrics, detects degradation, and generates alerts
- ✅ API endpoint tests with TestClient simulation
- ✅ Use of pytest and hypothesis for property-based checks

## Future Enhancements

1. **Integration with actual FastAPI TestClient** for real API testing
2. **Database integration tests** with actual persistence layers
3. **Performance benchmarking** with timing assertions
4. **Stress testing** with high-volume metric generation
5. **Concurrency testing** for multi-threaded scenarios
