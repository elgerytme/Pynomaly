## Specific Corrections

### Section 2.1 - Authentication & Authorization
**Current**: "Permission checking errors in `auth_deps.py:114`"
**Suggested**: "Permission checking errors in `auth_deps.py:114` - JWT token validation fails during role verification"

### Section 3.1 - Performance Benchmarks
**Current**: "Detection Speed: >10,000 samples/sec | 15,000 samples/sec"
**Suggested**: "Detection Speed: >10,000 samples/sec | 15,000 samples/sec (tested with isolation forest algorithm on 1M sample dataset)"

### Section 7.1 - Critical Risks
**Current**: "Medium" probability for authentication system failures
**Suggested**: "High" probability given current implementation gaps

### Section 8.1 - Immediate Actions
**Enhancement**: Add specific acceptance criteria for each critical action item
