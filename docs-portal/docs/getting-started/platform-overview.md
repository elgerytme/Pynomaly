# Platform Overview

The **Anomaly Detection Platform** is a comprehensive, enterprise-grade solution designed to detect anomalies across various data types and use cases. Built with modern software engineering principles, it provides a scalable, maintainable, and extensible foundation for anomaly detection workflows.

## üéØ Platform Mission

**To democratize anomaly detection by providing enterprise-ready tools that scale from research prototypes to production systems with minimal friction.**

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Philosophy

The monorepo is built on **Clean Architecture** principles with clear separation of concerns:

### Domain-Driven Design
- **Domain Layer**: Core business logic and entities
- **Application Layer**: Use cases and orchestration
- **Infrastructure Layer**: External concerns (databases, APIs, ML models)
- **Presentation Layer**: User interfaces (APIs, CLI, Web)

### Key Architectural Benefits
- **Testability**: Each layer can be tested in isolation
- **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries reduce coupling
- **Extensibility**: New features can be added without breaking existing functionality
- **Scalability**: Components can be scaled independently
