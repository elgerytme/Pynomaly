# Pynomaly Examples

This directory contains comprehensive examples demonstrating various aspects of the Pynomaly anomaly detection framework.

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is with the basic usage example:

```bash
python basic_usage.py
```

## Available Examples

### 1. Basic Usage (`basic_usage.py`)
**Perfect for beginners** - Learn the fundamentals of Pynomaly in under 5 minutes.

- Create and configure an anomaly detector
- Load and prepare sample data  
- Train the detector on normal data
- Detect anomalies in new data
- Understand detection results and confidence scores

**Use this example if:** You're new to Pynomaly or anomaly detection in general.

### 2. Algorithm Comparison (`algorithm_comparison.py`)  
**For method selection** - Compare different anomaly detection algorithms on the same dataset.

- Test 6 different algorithms: IsolationForest, LOF, OCSVM, COPOD, ABOD, KNN
- Evaluate performance with precision, recall, and F1-score
- Understand when to use each algorithm
- See execution time comparisons

**Use this example if:** You want to choose the best algorithm for your specific use case.

### 3. Ensemble Detection (`ensemble_detection.py`)
**For robust detection** - Combine multiple algorithms for more reliable anomaly detection.

- Create an ensemble of 5 different detectors
- Compare voting strategies: majority, unanimous, any
- Understand ensemble benefits and trade-offs
- Handle disagreements between detectors

**Use this example if:** You need highly reliable anomaly detection or want to reduce false positives.

### 4. Streaming Detection (`streaming_detection.py`)
**For real-time applications** - Process continuous data streams with real-time anomaly detection.

- Simulate real-time sensor data streams
- Handle streaming data with backpressure
- Real-time alerting and monitoring
- Ensemble streaming detection
- Performance tracking and metrics

**Use this example if:** You need to monitor data streams in real-time or build IoT monitoring systems.

### 5. Time Series Detection (`time_series_detection.py`)
**For temporal data** - Specialized anomaly detection for time series data with seasonal patterns.

- Extract temporal features (hourly, daily, weekly patterns)
- Handle seasonal decomposition
- Multi-algorithm comparison on time series
- Advanced feature engineering for temporal data
- Detect seasonal anomalies vs. trend anomalies

**Use this example if:** You work with time series data, logs, or any data with temporal patterns.

### 6. Custom Algorithm Integration (`custom_algorithm_integration.py`)
**For advanced users** - Integrate your own custom anomaly detection algorithms.

- Implement custom statistical detector
- Create algorithm adapters following the framework protocols
- Build custom ensemble methods
- Provide explanations and metadata
- Register algorithms in the framework

**Use this example if:** You want to extend Pynomaly with proprietary algorithms or research methods.

### 7. Web UI Integration (`web_ui_integration.py`)
**For web applications** - Integrate with the Progressive Web App and create dashboards.

- Multi-domain monitoring dashboards
- Real-time web UI simulation
- REST API endpoint examples
