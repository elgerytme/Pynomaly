# üöÄ CI/CD Workflows

This directory contains automated workflows for building, testing, and publishing the anomaly detection platform and its SDKs.

## üìã Available Workflows

### Core Workflows
- **`release.yml`** - Complete release management with validation, building, and deployment
- **`publish-pypi.yml`** - Dedicated Python package publishing to PyPI
- **`sdk-publishing.yml`** - Multi-language SDK publishing (Python, TypeScript, Java)

### Workflow Triggers
- **Release:** Triggered when a new release is published
- **Manual:** Can be triggered manually via workflow_dispatch
- **Push:** Some workflows trigger on specific tag pushes

## üîß Required Secrets Configuration

For the workflows to function properly, the following secrets must be configured in your GitHub repository:

### Python Publishing (PyPI)
```bash
# Production PyPI
PYPI_API_TOKEN=pypi-your-production-token-here

# Test PyPI (for testing releases)
TESTPYPI_API_TOKEN=pypi-your-test-token-here
```

### TypeScript Publishing (NPM)
```bash
# NPM registry token
NPM_TOKEN=npm_your-npm-token-here
```

### Java Publishing (Maven Central)
```bash
# OSSRH (Sonatype) credentials
OSSRH_USERNAME=your-sonatype-username
OSSRH_TOKEN=your-sonatype-token

# GPG signing (required for Maven Central)
MAVEN_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY=-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----...
MAVEN_GPG_PASSPHRASE=your-gpg-passphrase
```

### GitHub (Automatic)
```bash
# Automatically provided by GitHub Actions
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_automatically-provided
```

## üéØ Workflow Usage

### 1. Publishing All SDKs (Release)
```bash
# Create and publish a release - this will automatically publish all SDKs
gh release create v1.2.3 --title "Release v1.2.3" --notes "Release notes..."
```

### 2. Manual SDK Publishing
```bash
# Publish specific SDKs manually
gh workflow run sdk-publishing.yml \
  -f sdks_to_publish="python,typescript,java" \
  -f environment="production"

# Test publishing to staging registries
gh workflow run sdk-publishing.yml \
  -f sdks_to_publish="python" \
  -f environment="test"
```

### 3. Python Only Publishing
```bash
# Use the dedicated Python workflow
gh workflow run publish-pypi.yml \
  -f environment="pypi"
```

## üèóÔ∏è SDK Build & Publishing Process

### 1. Change Detection
- Automatically detects changes in SDK source code
- Only builds and publishes changed SDKs (unless manual override)
- Supports selective publishing via manual triggers

### 2. Validation Phase
- Starts API server for integration testing
- Runs comprehensive SDK validation suite
- Validates all SDKs against real endpoints
- Can be skipped for emergency releases

### 3. Build Phase (Per SDK)

#### Python SDK
- Uses `hatch` for building
- Builds both wheel and source distributions
- Validates package metadata with `twine`
- Publishes to PyPI or TestPyPI

#### TypeScript SDK
- Uses npm with Rollup for building
- Generates CommonJS and ESM bundles
- Includes TypeScript declarations
- Publishes to npm registry

#### Java SDK
- Uses Maven for building
- Generates JAR with sources and JavaDocs
- Signs artifacts with GPG for Maven Central
- Deploys to OSSRH (Sonatype)

### 4. Verification Phase
- Waits for packages to become available
- Tests installation from each registry
- Verifies basic functionality
- Generates comprehensive reports

## üìä Environment Configuration

### Production Environment
- **Python:** Published to PyPI
- **TypeScript:** Published to npm (public)
- **Java:** Published to Maven Central
- **Validation:** Full validation required

### Test Environment
- **Python:** Published to TestPyPI
- **TypeScript:** Published to npm with `beta` tag
- **Java:** Deployed to Maven Central staging (not released)
- **Validation:** Can be skipped

### Staging Environment
- Used for internal testing before production
- Same as test but with different deployment targets

## üîç Monitoring & Debugging

### Workflow Logs
- All workflows provide detailed logging
- Each step includes clear success/failure indicators
- Artifacts are stored for 30-90 days

### Common Issues

#### Authentication Errors
```bash
# Check if secrets are properly configured
gh secret list

# Update secrets if needed
gh secret set PYPI_API_TOKEN --body "your-token"
```

#### Build Failures
```bash
# Check the specific SDK build logs
# Look for dependency issues or test failures
# Verify local build works before pushing
```

#### Publishing Errors
```bash
# Version conflicts - ensure version numbers are unique
# Registry timeouts - workflows include retry logic
# Authentication - verify tokens have correct permissions
```

### Artifact Storage
- Build artifacts stored for 30 days
- Release reports stored for 90 days
- Logs available for configured retention period

## üöÄ Quick Setup Checklist

1. **Configure Secrets**
   - [ ] Set up PyPI API tokens
   - [ ] Configure NPM token
   - [ ] Set up Maven Central credentials
   - [ ] Generate and configure GPG key

2. **Test Workflows**
   - [ ] Run test publication to staging registries
   - [ ] Verify SDK validation works
   - [ ] Test manual workflow triggers

3. **First Release**
   - [ ] Create release with proper version tag
   - [ ] Monitor all publishing workflows
   - [ ] Verify packages are available
   - [ ] Test installation from registries
